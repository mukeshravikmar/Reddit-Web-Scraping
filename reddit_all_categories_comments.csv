That program failed 1 year ago - after about 5 years.  The were 1000 people laid off just this august an it's crystal clear the future is murky.  Prior to that I was at ford R&amp;D and I was working on their single shot detector - computer vision for their NGV AV.  Later NGV was sold off to argo ai.  Okay, I love coding and I also like applied mathamtics (using math to do useful things).  The future for warren looks a lot like integration engineering and the core autonomy is going to be moved to Cruise automation in silicon valley.  Translate probably more layoffs.  When I went to GM I was thinking they'd be doing AI/ML - this is far from the truth.  Kalaman filtering and alignment is the only thing they really do there.  All the cool AI/ML is being done in israel - in fact, I think they probably are the reason why UC failed.  They too are in a very precarious siuation.

Now my question:  GM Motorsports has a senior DS role (looks like GM acquired Pit Rho predictive analytics).  To me, if I get this role, then it unteathers me from automotive and robotics.  My only worry is that it's not GM's core business and this industry is cyclical so if they're going to cut - they're going to be the first to go.  But in trade, I figure I'll finally get to don a DS hat and pick up the skills.  I should be able to go into any industry or even get into MLE.  Can I get some sober opinions, what are some risks and what potentially some down sides.  How stable is DS is general.  That is, I get the job and maybe I'm scrubbing toilets, etc.  The other problem is that I have a SWE job in hand.  I've seen how crazy competitive it is to get a SWE job, I wouldn't be suprised if I'd have memory CLRS algo book to get get my old job back at GM.  So I'm also worried about future SWE opportunities if I want to get back into SWE type of jobs.

Hey everyone,
I realize this may have been covered in prior threads, but I need some solid advice for a beginner in the field. I’m trying to decide between several DS programs and I was wondering what the real difference between a MS and a BS degree would be for someone coming into the field with no prior experience. Since I have a degree in the arts, need several prerequisites in math and CS before I can enter into a degree program. Since this is the case, I’ve considered taking these prereqs and then applying for a MS program. But at that point, I’m wondering if it would just be better to get a bachelor’s degree that would include those prerequisites. I’m wanting to know if there is really much of a difference between a MS and BS since they tend to share similar classes and content. Does it change employment opportunities, pay, knowledge, etc? I live in Georgia but am open to other programs as well, and would prefer online if possible. Thanks!",Jarks44

Trying to introduce more intelligence in how we forecast a key customer's demand for the primary purpose of staffing and capacity planning.

Background, we're a contract mnfr and have some 400 SKUs for this customer. Maybe a quarter of which make up the bulk of production hours.

I'd like to deliver max-high-avg-low-min demand scenarios. This means first generating demand qtys then pushing them through a tool to generate production hours - the second part is critical, obviously to literally get the hours but also because every SKU takes different time across different equipment, so seeing how varied demand can vary production hours is a huge benefit over current methods.

I was recently turned on to Monte Carlo simulations. From what I gather, firstly you simulate demand based on avg, stddev, maybe correlations or exact probabilities. Secondly, you sample from those simulations many times and draw conclusions based on those many samples. So if I want to forecast the next 3 months, I'd run 1000 simulations, then do 1000 samples and average them.

Why not average from the 1000 simulations themselves, no sampling? I can push all 1000 simulations through the production hours tool and rank them 1 to 1000 from lowest to highest total production hours. Then, for instance, average the hours from the top and bottom 20 simulations as the max and min; average sims let's say 750-850 as a high; average 150-250 as a low; and the average of all as the average (which should be basically the average of actuals over the same timeframe anyways).

You may be scoffing at this, and that's why I'm here, I want to understand the flaws.

Our customer's demand isn't that random month-to-month. The last 3 months will be a far better predicter of the next month, than 12 months prior. If I've already limited my average and std dev for generating the simulations to the last 3 months, aren't those simulations themselves a good range of predictions that I can just analyze and explain from?

Maybe, I guess, since I have in fact limited the inputs to 3 months, randomly sampling is basically the same? But so what's the statistical or scientific reason for the sampling, then? What am I missing.

Appreciate it in advance. Stepping into a new world here. I've got R now (haven't played with it since college) and I've got ambitious thoughts racing through my head, but I want to make reasoned and professionally defensible steps forward and not just chase random ideas.",mityman50

I'm trying to get into data science/become a data scientist, but am a bit lost on the best way to get there - There's so much info and so many opinions out there it can get confusing and overwhelming, I could really use advice or guidance

**Where I'm at:**

* I've been working in data for about 4 years. I started as a data analyst where I mostly worked in Excel, had started doing some modelling (MMM) but not much, and had used Python briefly for preparing data.
* I started job hunting to move closer to data science and got a new job that promised that (advanced analytics, SQL &amp; python, and transitioning to data science/tist) however I haven't touched data once. I've mainly been doing BA work, data strategy stuff, and some project management. I did get to work with a guy briefly to build a dashboard using Python and Streamlit, but that's about it really. So I feel like I've really wasted my time at this company and have been strung along and moved further away from my goal.

**Where I want to be:**

* I want to move into a real data science role. I get that bc of the last 1-2 years I don't necessarily have the experience or skills for those roles and I am happy to move to a more analytical data analyst role or anything in between data analytics and data science. I'm starting to apply but think I could better use my time upskilling myself and building a portfolio and then applying seriously in the new year.

**What I need help:**

* Learning resources - there's so much out there I don't know what to focus on. What are the best courses or resources you'd recommend to get up to speed on the main data science skills? I can also do the Azure Data Scientist certificate through work - would that be helpful (in learning and job applications)? Are there any courses or certificates that have worked for you? Right now I'm doing a python BootCamp course as a refresher (I've done some computer science / programming courses at uni; python, SQL, c++)
* Plan till the end of this year - ideally, I want to focus on studying/portfolio building till the end of this year. What should I prioritise? I want to be smart about how I use my time and make sure I’m focusing on the right things.
* Any job hunting / next career move advice

**Background:**

Hello Everyone, I'm am currently an undergrad at a top 30 public university majoring in Economics with a minor in Mathematics. I’m graduating a semester early this December and plan to start an online master’s program to get ahead. I’ve been accepted to three programs, and I’m trying to figure out which one is the best fit. Thank you for any insight in advance!

**About Me:**

I’m really into prediction markets and have a lot of experience with sports betting (Modeling/Bookmaking side of it). This summer, I had a trading operations internship at a quantitative trading firm this summer (One of: Citadel, Jane Street, SIG, or Optiver). I loved the focus on probabilistic thinking, and I want to pursue a career in something like Quant Trading, Sports Trading, or something involving hands on predictions and markets. I didn't really enjoy the operations work so I turned down the return offer so I am currently also applying for jobs.

All the programs I got into are online and I will be starting one of them part time in the spring or fall. 

**The Programs:**

Johns Hopkins University - MS Data Science 

* Tuition: $53,000
* Credits: 30
* Pros: Really good brand recognition, Has best selection of classes 
* Cons:  Most Expensive one by good margin and it will be my first time taking out a loan, Have heard mixed reviews of how much Data Science degree holds in job market 
* [Courses/Curriculum](https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/data-science/courses/)

Penn State University - MS Applied Statistics

* Tuition:  $30,000 
* Credits: 30
* Pros: Applied Statistics might sound better and be more applicable to jobs I want
* Cons: Worst brand recognition out of the three schools 
* [Courses/Curriculum](https://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/penn-state-online-applied-statistics-masters-degree#courses)

Georgia Tech - MS Analytics

* Tuition:  $11,000
* Credits: 36 
* Pros: Cheapest by far, Have seen a lot of great reviews online  
* Cons: Wouldn’t be able to start until fall as I missed application cycle for spring so kinda wasting a semester, Not sure how good MS Analytics sounds vs applied statistics or data science

If you want to maximize your chance of going into Quant work, you would be best served by a combination of an academic program that funnels people into quant jobs and academic rigor.

John Hopkins and Georgia Tech are both known for producing students who go into Quant Finance. However, it is their Quantitative Finance Master's Degrees that produce the Quants. One option could be to attend one of those schools and try to transfer to the Quant Finance Master's Degree programs.

In defense of Penn State, Applied Statistics is far more applicable as an academic discipline for the world of Quant Finance and Sports Trading than Data Science or Analytics. So it wouldn't be the worst degree option.

If I were to personally give you a single answer though, I would ask my advisor if it is possible to take Quant Finance courses at John Hopkins. In second place would be Georgia Tech.",NerdyMcDataNerd

I graduated over a year ago with a masters degree in meteorology. Unfortunately the job market for meteorologists isn't the most inspiring and it has been a real uphill battle to try and find a suitable role. In the meantime I've had the chance to work on roles which are basically data scientist positions with an emphasis on meteorological applications. In both cases these ended up having to deal with NN models in PyTorch. My current role lasts till the end of the year and unfortunately since it was sort of a research based role on a project that is also wrapping up, I have to look for other opportunities.

Given that I feel that another data scientist position may be what is more feasible for me in the current market, I wanted to try and improve my skills and CV so that I can be better suited for more data science roles. Currently I obtained the jobs I got because my meteorology background was a prerequisite for the job but data science with a focus on meteorology isn't a very expansive field so I feel I need to do more so I can be a suitable candidate for other data science positions as well.

As someone with a scientific background (my undergrad degree was in physics as well), a LOT of my experience tends to lie primarily in Python. I feel I am a competent coder (nothing too special though). I have some brief experience with R from my time in university but no SQL I'm reasonably comfortable with machine learning having worked with different NN's including ANN's, CNN's, LSTM's etc as well as dabbling a bit with SVR and RF but have zero experience on the database side of things. Also zero experience with the cloud computing side of things which I've seen come up in plenty of applications as well.

Basically, what are the areas I can focus on improving/trying to add experience in so as to be a better candidate for more general data science positions and what are some good resources to go about doing so?",has14952

Given what I just explained... are there any particular concepts I should explore or learn more about to help with accomplishing this? Am I right to start looking into KNIME's data science free course they have?

I am a current chemical engineer working on a Master's in Data Analytics at my local university (Utah State). The time has come to register for my final elective, and I can't decide between these two:

\- **Data Pipeline Engineering:** From the data analytics department. ""This course explores the design and engineering of effectively structured data ecosystems. Using programming tools, students develop efficient and effective dataflows to ensure quality data are available to meet critical data analysis requirements.""  
\- **Introduction to Probability:** From the math department. ""Students study discrete and continuous probability, random variables, the distribution and density function, joint distributions, conditional probabilities and expectations, Bayes' theorem, moments, moment generating functions, inequalities, convergence in probability and distribution, and central limit theorem""

Additional background: my program has mostly been very applied. There has not been much theory so far, and after the upcoming semester all I have left is my capstone project (i.e. thesis). I will also be taking a required statistics course, Statistical Learning and Data Mining I, that will be more theoretical than most of my past classes, focusing more on the theory of the machine learning algorithms and techniques I have already applied in other classes. Even though I'm an engineer, I don't feel I have a particularly strong background in statistics (and I'm rusty anyway), especially if I want to be more data science (rather than business analytics) focused, but I can also see how data pipeline engineering could be a very useful class, especially to apply in the field I'm already working in.

Just wrote a whole post on my company site a few weeks ago regarding this specific issue.  Even if the DS team has ideas on what they think may add value to the company, this needs to be aligned with the corporate goals/objectives/challenges.  This will prevent scenarios where work is done and ends up not being valuable to the company, or they do work to address topics that management and executives don't even care about.


Having the DS team get involved on the front lines of the business related to projects they are working on can provide additional insights or to catch ""gotcha"" moments that might have occurred if the team didn't get in the metaphorical weeds and see how things were going in the business related to the project.


Lastly, I would level set with the analysts to determine whether they are wanting the scope of their work to be report builders.

Not saying business should come up with DS projects, I am saying that the projects that the DS TEAM COMES UP WITH should align with corporate objectives... So if an operations team is trying to gain operational efficiency and cost out for a particular part of the business (and they have a supporting data team) the data team should be working on various ideas and projects to help them meet those goals. Or if one worked in retail and was trying to figure out how external shrink (theft) initiatives were performing, the DS team could model shrink performance across initiatives and recommend the best methods that decrease shrink with the least sales impact. Again the business has their problems and objectives, and the DS team aligns their work around that.

\- Through superior selection and seamless service, we think we can grow customer segment X market share to 35% by attracting more customers and getting existing customers to use the service more

Build a plan to test rolling out ""superior selection"" however you want to define that and then measure directly the impact of your work on the market share change.

Secondly, the “Field of Dreams” approach of build it and they will come, is a failed enterprise.  Business needs are identified outside the DS team by possibly your process experts. Define a real problem, then assign DS to see if a solution is feasible and how model outputs would be incorporated in processes. This solution may take phases for implementation.  I believe a lot of ML solutions are rushed to be deployed only to die due to low adoption and lack of understanding. 

Start with C-Suite goals and focus over next 2 years. Approach business experts to identify high value issues. Then brainstorm with DS team to rough-in ML approach to support specific outcomes and rough-in development, deployment and training plans. Develop team of key-stakeholders to support the project during development and post deployment. Determine KPIs to identify success.

My solutions: 
1. The big one was moving the excel files I needed to share point. Multiple people can work on the same file, so R can access it. If I need I could use power automate too.
2. Use R to copy and paste the file every time you need to use it. You may run into problems if you don’t have a certain package, maybe ‘rtools’? It needs more permissions as it accesses your file network, so this may not be possible. (You might have already tried this tbh.)
3. You can do some weird power automate code to copy the file every so often. I did this once because I couldn’t get around the rtools problem in R, but power automate can. It was just a simple code to copy the file to a new file every hour. You could either do that and have it be an hour behind, or you could send a trigger from R, but that’s more complicated as you’d need to figure out how to tell R to wait for the copy to finish, and it’s a huge hassle.",SeriousDrakoAardvark

I have done tons of computer vision ML work. That's one of those fancy things people aspire to do right? Ok well I wasn't at FAANG and still got to do it. Got paid really well for it too. I can also say it was a lot more exciting when I was learning how to do it, pouring over paper after paper, fighting through a framework with far fewer tutorials available than are available today. Then I got to do it for money, and it was... fine.

The problem is we are sold this idea that getting to the top is going to fulfill us and I promise that is not true. In any endeavor. Money is great we need it to pay our rent but you can find money in a lot of places. I promise potential partners you actually get along with wont care that you work at place X vs Y unless place X is the torture nexus then you might be in trouble. Your friends will say it's great but they don't really care it's not their life. Then you realize it's not doing that much for you *either* and what even was the point?

More power to people whose sole goal is to get to a FAANG company. Me personally I'm more focused on making sure I work at a place where I don't have days I just dread walking through the doors and make enough to eventually retire.",redisburning

There are pros and cons to FAANG stuff.  Given what I've heard from friends, read from the internet, and learned from a bit of contract work in that space, the FAANG ""lifestyle"" isn't for me.  I think it's absolutely a fit for some types of people but it is not a be-all-end-all for every DS.  No one _has to_ do FAANG to be great.

---

I found a niche that I love in the data space: cleaning up data messes. Coming into a company that has terrible data practices, hodge-podges of data sitting everywhere, a warehouse that is untrustworthy and awkward, etc., and making plans to iteratively fix it.  There is something extremely satisfying seeing huge differences and big improvements from doing quick, basic ""best practice"" things.  (Yes, it's more Data Eng / MLE work than DS work but I still have to be up-to-date with my DS/ML chops to be useful in the field.)  There is not a whole lot of space/need for this kind of thing in FAANG.  There is a whole lot of space/need for this kind of thing in small companies that you've never heard of.

It is a tough job market out there right now.  I've been in this space for many, many years and this is the worst patch I've seen (besides, perhaps, 2008).  Keep on keeping on and remember to stop and think about what you _love_ as opposed to what you _should do_.",mite_club

I primarily ""change as I go"" in the codebase to make things align with a standard best practice (dbt's philosophy, aws guidelines, etc.) and _eventually_ I have changed enough in whatever direction I want that a ""larger"" change is much, much easier to sell.

For example, if I've already broken up a lot of large, monolithic SQL into smaller, ""atomic"" queries, it's easier to tell my manager we should try DBT to build staging models --- because, you know, we _already have a repo of staging models_.  

For a data science example, it was much easier to sell using MLFlow after slowly adding general logging and utility functions to the codebase (in the effort to get our stuff linted/formatted).  ""Well, all we have to do is add a small piece to the logging function and it'll come up in MLFlow.""

This is the way I've done things but I'm sure there's other, probably better, ways to do it.  I've found big changes can happen even in companies with a lot of inertia with slow, stead erosion.  Death by a thousand paper cuts kind'a stuff.

These roles are not necessarily all that technical, but strong technical skills can be a huge force multiplier when it comes to client work in ways that might not be obvious.

There are other roles in the sales org that might be titled ""Data Scientist"", ""Quantitative Researcher"", or ""Research Scientist"" without clear rhyme or reason why. These roles would be a step back from a MSP, focused on best-practices or other ads R&amp;D work within sales. They would also be in a different ladder.

Don't take it personally as it is always beyond your control, but I hope it will help set expectations to not take any word as guarantee that you got a job, and no number of interviews indicate you got the job.

**Company A**

The manager was a new manager likely and shouldn't have said anything until they went through the full list of candidates. It's likely they found someone who was better than you, and those weeks of silence reflects that they were interviewing other candidates and/or waiting for offer confirmation from the preferred candidate. Regardless, you shouldn't have been ghosted - they could've at least just said that it wasn't a match and not kept you hoping.

Another POV is most likely the budget got cut, the headcount got pulled, they got re-orged and don't need that capacity, or the team dissolved.

**Company B**

Most likely the Director did not find value in an internship opening. Instead, they prefer someone with experience in the industry because they have time critical objectives that needs to be addressed. Doctoral background, in this market, is not going to get you a senior role. In addition, it really depends on the company and their 'residency programs'.

**Company C**

Companies will not give feedback because it backfires 95% of the time - people get defensive or very angry and it's not worth the hassle from the company's perspective.

I am relatively new to the industry and have participated in about seven interviews in the past six months. One interview presented challenging questions that were difficult to address. During this interview, I was asked, “How do you act in conflict situations?” The question seemed to imply a scenario where an individual is overly aggressive, but it was unclear if that aggression was coming from the other person or myself.

In response, I stated that if there is an established policy or law regarding such disagreements, I would prioritize adhering to those guidelines and inform the HR department as soon as possible. Additionally, I emphasized the importance of seeking a solution and minimizing hostility in conflict situations.

The facial expressions from the interviewers indicated incredible disappointment in my response (I still sleep questioning it). Insights on effective strategies for answering this type of question from a business perspective would be appreciated. Thank you.",Specific-Sandwich627
1gq1c2j,Am I only one who is experiencing weird things in this job market?,lx12f32,lx103bi,"You basically answered by saying for any conflict scenario you’ll use the nuclear option. In other words, the answer you gave says that you have very little soft skills in terms of influencing, negotiating, or general people skills.

Ideally, you should address whether you’ll first try to resolve the issue by exploring the root cause, or resolving it between one another, or use the help of a manager. The question is expecting a more practical experience answer and not philosophical/HR answer, which is why it is vague - the answer doesn’t have to be even work related (you can talk about dealing with conflicts during your school years, friends, whatever), but you should demonstrate how you address conflict: and conflict doesn’t mean actual physical conflict. Conflict can be represented as disagreement on an approach where no decision is being made, someone not willing to listen to your view for whatever reason, or dealing with someone stubborn. As a data scientist/analyst, you’ll face this a couple of times (like a business owner rejecting your finding for whatever reason or a teammate disagreeing with your method towards approaching a problem).

All in all, take it as a lesson learned. Spend a lot of time watching YouTube videos based on those cultural questions. You really have to develop the soft skills muscles here and avoid nuclear option except for nuclear scenarios (like receiving direct harassment or death threats from colleagues). You can even read books like “Getting to Yes” or “How to win friends and influence people” which provides scenarios and stories on methods to help navigate conflicts.",forbiscuit

1) Completed phd, joined Amazon as an applied scientist intern. Management on my team was a total disaster, however I completed the internship successfully, and they liked the work I did. Team didn't have budget to hire me, but they gave me the ""inclined"" feedback (meaning I can easily join another team without further interviews). One hiring manager agrees to let me join his team, then completely ghosts. 

I talk to another hiring manager based in Barcelona, and he said the interview with him went well, but he would like me to talk with members of his team. He told me it would be informal and it would give his younger team members more interview experience, and the results of the interview wouldn't have any long term impact. The live coding round was at 7am, and I completely bomb. 

Hiring manager decides not to hire me as he was worried about my coding ability (but ignores the fact that I passed medium level leetcode problems to get the internship, and delivered a python package as part of my internship). 

Recruiter said no problem, probably just a bad day, continue to apply to jobs on the website if you see them. Since then, every job I apply for is auto-rejected within 24 hours. I was misled into going through an interview round and now it sounds like my inclined status is gone. Internship a complete waste. To be fair, every Amazon employee has a story of someone being stabbed in the back. Great culture tho



2) I apply to a small mobile app company that is hiring a data analyst. I easily pass the take home assignment and live coding round. The live coding round went so well they decide to schedule me a final round interview with another data scientist the next day. The recruiter said this would be another live coding round. The interview ended up being non-technical, and the interviewer asked questions such as “What’s the biggest culture shock you experienced” or “how many languages do you speak.” Despite making it through the technical rounds, my application was quickly rejected after this round and the recruiter completely ghosted me after.

Company 1:


After a initial call and 2 interviews with rhe VP of finance and Tech for a director level position (right under rhe VP guys), I got ghosted. Was really surprised since usually you at least get a rejection letter after an interview... even if it's canned. I was approached by their recruiter on that one so I was a little surprised at first by the titlex
, but turned out it looked like a good fit after the first interview.


Company 2:


Got in an interview with the hiring manager for the role. He definitely over committed amd was telling me about how the next interview would be in person and that he'd want me to meet the team before moving forward. Well, I was left without news for 4-5 weeks (I thought I was ghosted again), and I (surprisingly) got a rejection later that long after. They obviously were leaving their options open but still. That was posted as a IC DS position, but they wanted a manager.

\- Reduce the technical skills massively. List the top 5 and put them at the bottom

\- No one cares about a microsoft office specialist, this is just assumed to be there.

\- You can compress education as well

\- No one cares about how good your algorithm/ analysis was, bur what the business impact is. I know this is hard isnce you have limited experience, but try and reformulate your experience in terms of business impact/ or what is the new business asset. Even a forecast (total guesstimate) is better.

\- higlight any stakeholder experience you might have. When I hire junior/entry level people I mostly differentiate them by their soft skills rather than the technical. It is way easier for me and my team to upskill you in technical aspects than it is in stakeholder management, requirements management, and other soft skills.

\- If you are to be hired as a DS/DA most of the time you will work with non technical stakeholders. I need to know that you will be able to operate in that environment.

1gptbwk,Unlocking the full potential of data scientists ,lwxc7bh,lwtgm2c,"The definition of a manager varies based on company scale, so I'll break it down into two scenarios:

1- Enterprise-level manager

2- Manager in a Series-funded startup

In enterprises, you often see marketing professionals or business unit leaders becoming data science managers if they've developed some analytics and Python skills over time. They might not have strong DS backgrounds.

What I expect from these managers:

\- Should have worked as a data scientist or at least won a few Kaggle medals

\- Shouldn't be overly confident in their knowledge and should be genuinely open to feedback, not just claiming to be

\- In enterprises, things keep running smoothly even if you do nothing. Since the main goal is 'don't break anything,' taking risks with new initiatives is challenging for managers. They need to be able to bend bureaucracy for good ideas. But here's the truth: you get +5 points for something good, but -10 for something bad! 😄



For Series A+ startups, managers tend to be younger with solid data experience

For experienced DS-turned-managers in startups, I have one main expectation:

\- When they spot an opportunity they believe in, they should occasionally break away from the urgent/important matrix and deliver an MVP or model within a few sprints, even if it means going against normal prioritization (not always, but sometimes)""",mbartu

Conspicuously absent from that list is anything to do with code or data collection.  As a consequence I spent many hours collecting data that didn't affect my marks at all.  I'd have been so much better off if I'd put that time into better experiments (ten fold CV, different sizes, etc).  

I'd strongly encourage you to pick a topic that a) you're already a subject matter expert in, and b) you can bail someone up for data.  

I wouldn't be scraping travel sites because there's no marks for writing a scraper.  I would beg a travel company - you never know, they might help out just to be nice.  I'd also run a bunch of other ideas in parallel so if the travel company doesn't come through then someone else should.

What about movies using the Netflix data?  You could create your own features with a bit of scraping from IMDb and show where and how that improves the recommendation.

If you get GLMs, you basically don't need anything else. I have not yet found a situation where a GLM isn't a good solution. It is almost always a ""more correct"" solution than t-tests/z-tests/chi-square/etc. too.

I've always wondered why stats courses start with t tests and chi squares, and typically almost never get to linear models. Or if they do, it's an afterthought.

This makes no sense to me. There are two reasons for my rationale here:

1. Most of the statistical tests you will use in your life are a special case of the linear model. If you understand how to apply GLMs, you very rarely need to know one of the many named tests -- you can just use a GLM and do valid inference.
2. Most of the named tests only apply in very narrow situations where you have designed your experiment carefully to ensure ""random"" assignment. Pretty much the only domain where this is given proper care is in clinical trials. If you haven't done this, there are probably 101 covariates that confound your result -- and if you don't make an effort to account for them (e.g. by using a GLM and including covariates as model terms) then you're going to come to wrong conclusions.",McJagstar

In general, the downside of making no effort to address covariates is greater than the downside of addressing them with a GLM. If they don’t matter, the outcome will be the same. If they do matter, you’ll be glad you used a GLM.

The business may not trust you to deliver or cater to their needs. To change this you need to act more like a consultant internally. 

One thing I often see is that analytics/it does not communicate well with the business. For example, at my current client the analytics team is invited to meetings with our stakeholders and doesn’t show up to the meetings. The stakeholders do and of course they feel like we are listening to them and delivering on their needs and notice that analytics/it is noticeably absent from these meetings. 

One way to quickly build credibility is to work with the consultants in delivery and take credit for their work. They are probably happy to have you do this. The more they can be seen as playing nice in the org the better for them. If things go wrong blame the consultants. It’s what we are there for. 

Along this same line I recently tried to give credit to the IT/analytics org and the refused to take it! In fact they were upset that I wanted to co-present at the sprint demo 😂. Once again who will the business see delivering? Us.

I wouldn’t view an internal teams decision to not participate in these engagements as some failure on their part or inability to understand business needs.

We also use the clients internal processes for deployment but in this case we are the ones responsible for defining them. If it all goes wrong they get to blame us 😀

Do internal folks need to be in every meeting? Absolutely not, but in the case where you have stakeholders that you struggle to build strong relationships with face time counts for quite a bit. It is harder to dislike someone to their face. 

It’s the same reason consultants take clients to nice dinners and team building activities. It’s harder to dislike us after we talk and break bread. 

I’m sure someone will point out that they aren’t hired to build relationships or something, but in my opinion that is what makes people successful long term.

I think this can be a trap for many DS teams that inevitably leads to what OP describes. My current organization initially followed this approach (who doesn't want better communication and a larger DS presence); however, it led to DS taking a more subservient approach and kept them out of the decision making cycle. 

Without a mandate of DS as institutional experts adjacent teams made their own methodological decisions, hired their own vendors, and validated their own analyses.  DS was only brought in late in the process to pull data, conduct pre-determined analysis, or put together a product largely formed by non-experts. Whenever DS  tried to take the initiative it was met with incredulity, then pushback, then slow-rolling. The non-DS teams expected DS to have unlimited bandwidth to make work what they devised in a vacuum - they did not expect the DS team to make unrequested changes or propose improvements to their work.

Fortunately, org leaders have helped spur some change but many internal teams are reluctant to give up the domains they carved out and the vendors they hired.",Illustrious-Mind9435

Thanks for the feedback!! My model currently deals with reviews of people who have already bought a specific product. I don't have any data regarding why people did not buy a product. I was thinking of using a discrete choice models at the moment. 

The purpose of my model is to determine why a person liked a product and bought it. A big problem with this was that my data suffered from a major class imbalance in which I had way more 5 star reviews compared to any other reviews. This makes sense since the majority of people know what they're looking for, and therefore will give a product a 5 star review. 

In order to make my model useful, I used a mixed sampling approach in which I oversampled the low scores. These low scores allowed the model to understand that a person didn't like a specific product because it didn't meet their concerns. 

Because these low reviews are where most of the actual information comes from and the fact I have 300k reviews in comparison to around 1300 products, this makes the review feature much more valuable to the model. 

I was able to validate these features by using stepwise selection. I found that adding makeup finish based features, such as a matte finish or a dewey finish, boosted my F1 score by 6%.",pansali

School is useful for leaning more deeply about theory and figuring out how to do research and think (and convincing others that you have done so).

However, I see the masters as an opportunity for you to change tracks and modernize. If you focus your masters on ML/AI then you can come out of that potentially doing different work and more current topics.

What I see a lot happening right now in the field is a combination of ML and AI in agents and systems. So it’s not good enough to just go out and learn a GenAI or traditional ML. You definitely want both the LLMs and the machine learning fundamentals &amp; practice to put everything together into a system making recommendations or an agent capable of making autonomous decisions. 

So I’d either go to a masters in data science that allows you to take electives/track in AI unless you just want to change completely to computer science or something else.

Regarding the certifications, I’m a bit more pragmatic and I feel like having one of them is good just to show potential employers you know one cloud system as well as get past some of the bots- I would suggest either AWS or Azure and stay away from Google.

1.I could stay at my current job and work my way up, but with this job market and the many layoffs my company has had, I don’t want to be unable to get another job if I get fired

2. Most DS job postings I saw had a masters degree required

- can we look at drift detection and redeployment strategies?
- deal with missing data
- think about hardware
- take a look at cluster analysis. Maybe identify niches and train different models for them
- maybe look at where the heuristic model tends to fail and identify or detect those conditions so you could only run inference when the label isn't 'obvious' heuristically
- see if there are better ways of serving your model. If it's more expensive than the heuristics, maybe only serve it on off-peak hours or whenever it could have the best business impact
- question the business case to make sure you aren't solving a non-problem
- examine column dtypes. You can go lighter and faster with appropriate downcasts or maybe you notice you sacrificed too much precision or something
- if you can't improve the results themselves, maybe polish the presentation of your results
- try dimensionality reduction on subsets, like maybe the least important features
- update your dependencies
- calibration
- compare results to a RF on your top 3 features (instead of a dummy stump)
- ask a mentor or colleague for advice/ideas/insight/code review
- hand-label a few samples to get 'psychologically closer' to your data
- stratify your splits
- consider additional stratification by an important categorical or binned continuous
- consider what other useful business insights are in your data. Maybe your model can actually be a multi label classifier, which might justify the increased cost

You don't have the original inputs nor the embedding algorithm.

I don't think that it is possible to get the original inputs because embedding algorithms are (almost in 100% of cases) not loss-less. Here's a very crude proof (please excuse me, it has been a long time):

- Suppose there is a non-lossless embedding algorithm that maps a set of inputs I to a set of embeddings E.
- Since this is a non-lossless embedding, the number of elements in I is strictly greater than the number of elements in E.
- Therefore, there exists at least one element e (in E) that is mapped to by i1 and i2 (in I).
- So, given e, we cannot guarantee the original input.*

Real example:

- We have an embedding algorithm that outputs a vector of size 2 that counts the number of occurrences of the word ""dog"" and ""cat"" in the input.
- For some embedding vector e = {1, 1}, can we obtain the original sentence?
- No, there are an infinite number of inputs that could have resulted in e. ""I have a dog and a cat"". ""The dog chased the cat"". ""The cat chased the dog"".

*The only reason why this works for an encoder-decoder network is that we have the context trained and learned by the model to get back close to the original input. If we have a lossless embedding, then this falls closer to the realm of cryptography.

While you probably can't extract the exact inputs out from the embeddings, you can do things like cluster analysis, vector analysis (e.g., TF-IDF for word embeddings), etc. in order to get a general understanding of the original data - but you definitely cannot reproduce the original input exactly.",mizmato

I didn't necessarily intend to get perfect recoveries but at least my thought process was if there is such a method, I could at least get some extent of semantic sense from a given embedding vector. So using your example, while I won't be able to exactly get original text input, I can at least ""glean"" into making sense that semantically the keywords around said embedding of some sentence involve ""cat"" and ""dog"". 

To that end, I was hoping to also then compute some other embedding that lives in-between the existing embeddings from some actual input text data, reverse-embed them and then get some semantic sense of the keywords for the ""in-between"" computed embeddings.

I think the non-linear activation functions are really what makes it impossible to go backwards. For example, for the relu function, if you know the value of the input you can easily get the output (e.g., relu(1) = 1, relu(-1) = 0) but you can't go backwards (e.g., inv_relu(1) = 1, inv_relu(0) = {0, -1, -2, -3, ..., all X less than or equal to 0}).

I would recommend trying to solve this problem by first simplifying the problem. Try building an encoder without any non-linear activation functions and then analyze the output embeddings.

Pricing is not a cost-driven process, cost is just a constraint. Companies will charge as much as they can as long as the consumers buy the product, so all you need is perception of value (or an excuse to charge more as long as your competitors do the same). The pandemic gave companies both. Population was more concerned about the supply chain and availability of products (increased perception value), everyone was worried about logistics cost and increasing prices.

The idea is pretty simple: companies had been fearful about price increases for so long in fear they'd lose sales and worrying whether or not their competitors would do the same.

Events like these introduce a level of uncertainty that no model can fully eliminate.

There will always be an element of unpredictability that we simply can’t account for, no matter how sophisticated the model. Forecasts are valuable, but they must be grounded in the understanding that some uncertainties are beyond reduction.

Yet, I would argue that one can build a set of models that can be used to get a good estimate of future inflation within a certain set of boundaries of course.

In order for this to work, one of course will need to have a good understanding of macroeconomics. In macroeconomics forecasting inflation is already a big research topic and hence different approaches have been gathered over the years - like Phillips curves for example, but also more ML based approaches. The important thing here is to have (1) a good understanding of economic fundamentals and (2) a lot of high-quality (and likely high granular) economic data.

In your case I would try to build a set of models, using different approaches each. See what works for you and what not. You will use these models to simulate different future market behaviors to get an estimate of how inflation might change, depending on how the other economic fundamentals change.

However, to help you on the question (you asked about Data Science!), here's how I would approach it working only with SARIMA:

1. Check for stationarity. It is pretty obvious, even without ADF test, that the series is not stationary because of non-constant mean and variance (d=1). That means the time series needs differencing (start with 1st-order).

2. Perform seasonal decomposition to check the seasonality (yearly? monthly? weekly? depends on the frequency of your data points). 

3. Use ACF and PACF plots on the stationary data to see which lags seem most important. These will represent the AR and MA components of your SARIMA model. So you define p, q.

4. Then identify the seasonal components P,Q and S, considering the frequency of the data and the ACF/PACF plots from previously. Also, if it needs seasonal differencing D (if the series has a stable seasonal pattern over time).

Now you should have a rough estimation about the SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q,S) you might want. Go on and test it, and then evaluate and reiterate with other parameters.

If you also have some external time series, consider adding them as ""exogenous variables"" so that you now have a SARIMAX model.

1gmijk9,Need some help with Inflation Forecasting ,lw4vews,,"&gt;Can someone direct me in the right way please.

What you're asking goes beyond DS and falls into quantitative finance.

Here's a couple of ways you can predict inflation:

1. Inflation uses lagging rental prices by about 9 months.  You can get inflation without housing and then use sites like Zillow to calculate out less lagging housing and combine it in.  Technically this gets you more accurate inflation than the official number, but it also predicts the official number due to the fact that the official data is lagging.

2. You can use commodities prices, especially oil, to predict the goods part of inflation.  Think about it this way: Most products need to travel to get to their destination.  Be it raw parts that need to travel to a factory to be turned into a finished product, or moving that product from the factory to consumers.  All of it takes oil.  Furthermore, products are built from raw materials.  Those raw materials are commodities, so if commodities, like metal, go up in price, metallic products will also go up in price.  For food, commodities like soy are in most food products in the US so if soy spikes in price most of the food in the US will go up in price.

I can go on but hopefully those are good starting places to predict inflation.

&gt;PS: the data is seasonal but not stationary 

FYI, inflation is not normally seasonal, beyond very mild changes.  Not enough seasonality to be useful.  However, commodities are seasonal, so you can map out the seasonality there and then use it to predict inflation.

**ELI5:**  Inflation is an aggregate.  Break up the aggregate into its baser parts (its features), then predict the future for those, then aggregate the predicted pieces back together.

Also, as someone who works in forecasting, I can tell you anecdotally based on networking that the top data scientists and companies are using these global modelling techniques. From personal experience, they outperform ARIMA/ETS and their variants. To be clear though, this is only the case when you're forecasting many time series (hence the ""global"" models), e.g. thousands of products. If you're only forecasting a single time series then probably ML models and stats models are roughly similar in performance.

	•	Outlier Detection &amp; Correction: Instead of using generic transformations like winsorization or logs, you could try more sophisticated methods of outlier detection tailored to your time series data. Look for specific periods where the outliers due to COVID are most prominent and treat them as special events. This can involve:
	•	Smoothing the data for those specific months.
	•	Piecewise Linear Regression: You can use a segmented regression approach to model the “normal” trend before and after COVID and treat the affected period separately.
	•	Dummy Variables for COVID Periods: You can create a dummy variable indicating whether the data point falls in the COVID-affected period and model this as an additional regressor in your time series model. This could allow the model to better understand and adjust for the outliers.

2. Use Robust Time Series Models:

	•	Robust SARIMA/ARIMA: Standard SARIMA models may not work well with such disruptions. You can try using a robust version of SARIMA/ARIMA, which down-weights the impact of large outliers. This can be done through modeling techniques such as Huber regression or Quantile regression for time series.
	•	Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS): This method can model irregularities in the data by using a state-space approach. It allows you to build a robust model by including flexible seasonality and regression components, as well as adjusting for outliers or structural breaks.

3. Decomposition of Series:

	•	Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS (STL): Decompose your data into seasonal, trend, and residual components. Then, try to build your model on the trend component while isolating the impact of the seasonality. After handling the trend and seasonality, the residual component should be more manageable.
	•	After decomposition, you can either model the residuals separately (e.g., with ARIMA) or treat them as additional noise for other models.",Antique-Act2144

2. Then I figured out roughly what the probability of the daily price falling into either of the outlier distributions.

3. Then made a little model where I would sample a probability, if it was a ""regular"" day I would sample from the normal distribution

4. If it was an outlier day I would then sample a probability again to determine if it was a big positive or negative movement, then sample from the distribution I would see in the tail.

**Google Flu Trends model**

During the early 2000’s, Google attempted to track and predict flu cases by linking keyword searches to areas of flu cases. While it initially worked well, the model was purely based on correlations between keywords and flu outbreaks with no regard for sound theory. As a result, the model ended up overestimating flu cases during outbreaks, compared to what the CDC data indicated, and underestimating cases during non-seasonal outbreaks. I think the Google Flu Trends model is a good example of the “Big Data Hubris” and the need for proper data collection and theory to inform hypotheses.



**1936 Literary Digest Poll**

The Literary Digest was a respected publication at the time, having correctly called many prior elections. After receiving about 2.4 million postal opinions from its readership, it confidently predicted Landon winning when Roosevelt actually ended up winning by a landslide. Unsurprisingly, TLD isn’t around today. Explanations for TLD’s missteps centered on selection biases in its readership survey: its audience were mainly wealthier people who didn’t accurately represent the population and were more likely to favour the republican candidate. So why did it mainly end up with rich people in its survey? Because it mainly reached out to people who owned telephones and automobiles - both relative luxuries at the time. A good example of sampling bias. 



**Vietnam body count metric**

This case study is a prime example of how using a metric with poor internal validity can lead to poor outcomes. The US Secretary of Defence at the time, Robert McNamara, was enthusiastic about using data analysis to measure the progress of the war. However, relying on enemy body count itself as a primary metric was extremely unreliable since those counts could be inflated and there wasn’t always a good criteria for establishing who could be correctly counted as a combatant. We all know how the Vietnam War went down. This case study may provide lessons on the need for carefully constructing KPIs, and how politics can render metrics ineffective. 



**1986 Challenger disaster**

I remembered this story during a class on logistic regression. After numerous setbacks and delays, the decision makers were under pressure to launch in less than ideal conditions despite reservations about safety. The shuttle exploded a little over a minute, killing all 7 crew. The reason? The O-rings responsible for sealing within the booster joints became deformed owing to the cold weather. NASA made the decision to launch based on an incomplete picture where they discounted launches conducted in colder weather, which also had a higher probability of failure. Why? Because they assumed that those launches weren’t relevant.

1glrmz2,Data Science vs. the Interruption Culture,lvwzh4r,lvwibs1,"Agree with this. In the microsoft ecosystem there is an object Focus Time for the calendar. Blocking when work gets done is what it's useful for.

It is good documentation practice that when inevitably the team expects you to cut focus time for a meeting or fire drill, let them know that this cuts into development time and may need to revise deliverable dates.

When I've faced similar constraint started giving my direct supervisor recurring updates on the top priority list. Often this list may not change if there are many conflicting interruptions. Over time found it's best to both briefly share what top of the priority list, *and a short list of projects not moving forward because they are lower priority*. This eliminates ambiguity if your boss is losing sight of what is truly important. I've seen where priorities shift at the executive level, not communicated down the chain because people get busy. You may recognize when you have priorities 1, 2, then 3. Then while working on priority 1 you're asked where priority 3 is. When you have the recurring paper trail of the lower priority projects not moving forward when t's not one year later there's no wiggle room that the direct supervisor was not informed where projects stand. Nobody remembers with clarity the conversations two weeks prior. It's easy to pull up the old notes from prior check ins.",decrementsf

1glrmz2,Data Science vs. the Interruption Culture,lvwjfxf,,"&gt; Any other tips out there from people who just want to get their work done?

Honestly? Find a new employer.

Meeting culture is real. I’ve worked at places in big tech (FAANG) at which it was a badge of honor to have a full calendar. “Oh, you think you’re busy? Look at my calendar!” That’s bullshit. If you can’t get quality work done in 40hrs because 30 hrs was taken up by meetings and 4 hours was taken up by “code switching” from meetings to getting back into work mode, you’ll always be behind and your employers will keep pushing and pushing for more of your time at the same pay rate. 

Bullshit to that, I say.

I recently took a Sr. DS gig at a smaller, non-FAANG, non-tech company (but with an excellent salary)  and the culture is not “stack your calendar with meetings.” The culture is “do good work amd talk to people when you need to.” It’s refreshing to be able to focus and do quality work instead of bouncing from call to call, unable to focus. It marvelous, really.

Culture differences at companies exist and finding the right fit can be tough. I’ve been around enough to know what I like and what I don’t, and I’m unwilling to work for one of those “busy with meetings because that’s the expectation” places again.

ETA: if you can’t leave for a new gig, talk to your boss. Be protective of your time. Have some blockers that give you time to focus. Before I left FAANG, I carved out 3 hrs each day for my own personal focus time. The rest of my time was open for booking. If it was booked that day, okay. If not booked the day before, I’d work to manage the rest of my calendar to keep meetings in a block so I could have more focus time.",MattDamonsTaco

1glf6ul,Is Job Hopping Frowned Upon in Data Science? Or is the function too in demand to care?,lvuk5al,,"As someone who has worked in tech and now hires people in tech, I say it's normal to see people hop every few years in these kinds of fields. A lot of people do it to get a raise or keep up with inflation. As long as you're moving up in title, skill set, and you have added value, then it's okay! I’ve never had anyone ask me why in an interview and I’ve believed if you’re not earning and learning, it’s time to leave. You’re doing yourself a disservice staying if the only reason is you don’t want to appear to be job hopping. That doesn't mean some companies don't see it as a red flag, though.

 
Advances in Big data, ML, or AI can be hard to keep up with if you stay at the same company for too long. Avoiding that is why I mention JID! JID is a smart tech career tool that highlights professional growth. Developers make their detailed profiles and employers then directly approach them. It’s anonymous until the candidate decides otherwise, making it perfect for browsing or introspecting in your tech journey. I use it and think it would be perfect for you too! Another ""trick"" is Echotalent AI. Because it personalizes your resume to the ""tech lingo"" used by your future employer, having many multiple jobs become almost advantageous!",hola-mundo

I could probably get chatgpt to write this stuff. But a) I wouldn't learn b) I would fail (because writing code is just a small part of the coursework) and c) the code would break often enough that I might as well learn it. Instead, I use chatgpt and copilot as a troubleshooting/typing tool, and to give me bullet points on topics to assist my studying.

I do run into people who lean to heavily on it, when we're in breakout groups it's obvious they don't know wtf is going on, and (worst of all) they don't seem to know what they don't know. I'm also friends with one of my classmates who is crushing everything, and he uses gen AI the same way I do. He's learning everything, doing the work, and using chatgpt to enhance his work.

Another lesson from my grad school experience: the more advanced the subject, and the more specific the question, the higher the likelihood that chatgpt will be wrong.

If you want to do it 'quick' maybe try using a small language model (distilbert for example), which is pretrained with a different objective function, and fine-tune it for sentiment analysis. There are loads of small language models on huggingface and many datasets for sentiment analysis too. If you stay within the huggingface ecosystem (i.e use their APIs for datasets and training) you can probably do it all in a small python script. It should count as transfer learning since you're using a model that was trained on another task, and for the ensembling, you can make a bag of models using another small language model that you finetune (e.g distilgpt)  and combine the predictions. Do it in a colab notebook to train using the free GPU hours.

That said, it's only one paradigm and is falling out of favor in the SWE world at least somewhat as we figure out that the massively abstracted C#/Java/C++ codebases have drawbacks. The current crop of rising languages tend to mix OO/functional/imperative paradigms and not skew too heavily towards any one and for good reason.

My personal take as someone who moved fully over into SWE, mostly writing ""harder"" languages like C++, Rust, Scala (please pay attention to those quotes), is that SKLearn's interface is fine but largely overkill. It makes the pieces more easily swappable, and as such more easily configurable, which is nice for production maintenance sort of.

Where I have a real bone to pick is PyTorch. I despise PyTorch, I think it their wholesale buying into OO was a mistake, and has caused by far the largest percentage of ""bad"" Python I have seen in over a decade writing code at work. It is baffling to me that people prefer this over TF's functional model composition, the actual best way to do all of this IMO.

For long periods of time, I devoured any Rust information I could.

And if you do that, then all of a sudden showing folks you can be an engineer is a lot easier. C++ is tougher because the qualty of resources is so much more variable.

1gk4s66,OOP in Data Science?,lvkwg86,,"OOP is really useful in production code. One of the big things you'll run into with production code is that your code shouldn't just return analytically correct results, **but the code itself should be robust and reliable**. Most data science work is done in Python, but duck-typed languages like that with complex data types leave a lot of room for errors and exceptions when you get some unexpected inputs. OOP is one tool that can help with that.

  
To be production-grade, your code should be testable by writing things like unit tests and functional tests. OOP is a useful tool in writing your code that helps organize it into *distinct units of functionality*, which are more straightforward to test. If you're having difficulty writing tests for your code, it's a good indicator that you should refactor it into functions or classes that are easier to understand.



Once you get the fundamentals down, you can learn about design patterns which can make your code much more flexible while remaining reliable and robust. The need for this level of design can vary depending on the type of DS work you do. If you're more analytical, probably not. If you're building software and bigger backend systems, then they're definitely useful.

  
Writing classes is also a good way to *extend the functionality of other libraries*. Maybe you're building ML models for a production system, and you want your pickled sklearn model to include other things like a custom prediction threshold for that particular model, or parameters from a parameterized SQL query for the training data (like if you queried for a specific date range). This way, when you load the model into a prediction script, you have the important information needed to actually run the model as intended. You could do a basic wrapper class like the following, then pickle your instance of this class instead of the sklearn model itself:

    class MySklearnModel:
        def __init__(
            self,
            trained_sklearn_model,
            prediction_threshold: float,
            query_params: dict[str]
    ):
        self.model = trained_sklearn_model
        self.prediction_threshold = prediction_threshold

1gk4s66,OOP in Data Science?,lvntun5,,"In my experience you'll find that data scientists really fall along a spectrum in terms of their use of procedural vs OOP vs functional programming.

Many people who occupy data science roles came from a variety of quantitatively heavy backgrounds and the kind of programming experience vary a lot. And once code for data science, coding practices really aren't the main focus of what they're doing. So they will use whatever mix they know.

I've seen it range from some old senior data scientist who did everything proceduraly and barely even coded any functions, to some junior guy who was a super strong C# programmer who, even now that everything he was doing was happening in python, couldn't fathom the idea of not having absolutely everything in his code belong to a class.

I would say that as a junior who doesn't have that much experience in terms of data science yet, you'll want to become a decent developer. You will not have the luxury of having had 20+ years of experience in your craft before programming became unavoidable, and of having a bunch of juniors under you to do that work. A lot of the value you'll be able to generate in the early years of your career will come from your ability to actually get shit done. That means doing in yourself.

Becoming comfortable with OOP (you don't have to be an expert at it. But you should be able to understand what's going on and know enough about it to hold your own in a conversation with actual developers) will likely be a significant asset.

Sure, you can just get things done with functions, but classes bring structure, especially when pipelines start getting complex with multiple stages (processors, estimators, evaluators—the whole shebang).

In industry, OOP is handy because it makes code modular and reusable. Imagine you have a pipeline class with pre-processing, model selection, and evaluation all wrapped in neat little packages. Need to swap out the model? Change one line instead of re-jigging half your code. If you’re looking to upskill, check out courses on design patterns or even Kinetic Seas’ AI infrastructure—it’s a good example of how industry-level setups use modularity to keep things flexible at scale.

1gk4s66,OOP in Data Science?,lw46edx,,"Moving from notebooks to using classes for defining pipelines is pretty standard in the industry, especially as projects get more complex. Classes can make code a lot more organised and scalable, which is a big plus when dealing with multiple steps in a workflow e.g. preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

Using classes allows for modular code design and makes things more reusable. E.g. if you need to swap out one part of the pipeline, like changing a preprocessing step, you can do that without needing to rewrite the whole pipeline. It’s also easier to debug and maintain, which helps in the long run. Plus, with classes, you’re working more in line with OOP principles like encapsulation and inheritance, which is generally considered good practice in model development.

If you’re looking to dive deeper into this, honestly, the sk-learn documentation itself is helpful since it has examples of using pipelines and classes for modular workflows.

You can get more accurate forecasts by combining other techniques. [See here for an example](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9202617). But it won't necessarily make the point 10 years away more accurate in comparison to the point 1 year away.

But at the end of the day, the trustworthiness of a forecast into the long-term future depends mostly on the judgment of the person making decisions based on the predictions.

But also, if you think about it, as time goes by, the 10 years become 9.9, 9.8, etc. If you keep updating the model with the more recent data, naturally your prediction of the forecast will become more accurate as the date approaches.

My expectation was that the model, given this amount of data, would “learn” the tendency to underestimate in longer horizons and adjust accordingly.

1gjij6n,Customer Segmentation - Mixed Data Types,lvdgup1,,"so i have been looking into this on a 'theoretical'/armchair level


rather than segmenting based on rfm, i would suggest using a customer lifetime value model (which roughly speaking  uses rfm values as inputs)
and segment based on that.
ie low value/infrequent customers, middle and high

(see eg clvtools r package)


on a separate note, you might want to look at the work of byron sharp, how brands grow, and peter fader,'customer centricity'

byron sharp
there is a double jeopardy law, the only way to grow your product is to get more users (and by the by, some will become heavier). no company has grown by just getting a small group of users to buy more and more

'byron' pareto law: 20% of your (annual?) users drive only 50-60% of your sales. focus instead on the long tail of new/infrequent users for which it is easier to get them to eg double up their purchasing

fader subscribes to double jeopardy but believes in the 'traditional' Pareto law of 20% of your customers drives 80% of your traffic.

he also doesnt recommend aiming at your highest performing customers, but if i understand some mid value customers, or using the insights from high value customers to find new customers which share traits...

1gjij6n,Customer Segmentation - Mixed Data Types,lvdsxt3,,"Great topic! When working with mixed data types for unsupervised learning, I’ve found that using models like k-prototypes (which handles both categorical and numerical data) or Gower distance (a measure that works well for mixed data) can be effective for clustering. Preprocessing is crucial; I typically standardize numerical features and encode categorical variables using methods like one-hot encoding or label encoding, depending on the model.



For more nuanced approaches, some practitioners run separate cluster analyses for categorical and numerical variables, then combine the results using ensemble methods or apply dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA for numerical data, MCA for categorical data) before clustering.



In terms of adding value, using ML for customer segmentation has allowed my team to uncover unexpected customer personas that didn't surface with RFM analysis alone.

If marketing suggested looking at how often someone scans through the skin selection of a given user's favourite champion, can't you instead use a rule-based approach to target those that do this a lot, but are yet to generate any income whatsoever, paired with a couple of other simple rules? I'm wondering if you truly need ML for that. 

Or if the example was Candy Crush, and one of the dimensions was time spent on the first part of the purchase funnel for an added-benefit. If marketing suspects it's an important dimension, can't you immediately target those at the higher end (assuming they're people who want to get educated with the in-game product) with a personalised strategy already. Again, I'm wondering what added value would ML provide here, because we're aware a customer like this will exist.

I haven't binned the data as you suggested, but I did normalize them using a standard scaler. It should be noted that I confirmed there are no egregious outliers in the data before I did so.

As for RFE, I more or less got rid of features that were inter-correlated (&gt;0.70 for Pearson's coefficient), but what you really want to do is take your time out to pick the relevant features from your raw data. Discuss with your business what the important features are, or should be, and create/extract them only. Build a base model with those features and figure out a validation metric. Once you've gotten a way to judge your model, you can start involving more features and versioning your model.

Segmentation for targeting... Is just dumb.  I wouldn't put it that bluntly to a stakeholder, but a lead DS ought to know better.  You have a behaviour you want, build a model for that behaviour.  Don't build some segmentation and then target your segments, that's horrifically roundabout.

There's plenty of papers on using ordinal and categorical variables in unsupervised clustering.  You could start with one hot encoding or I've had success with PCA too.

1gjij6n,Customer Segmentation - Mixed Data Types,lvf2c2e,lvebb4o,"So we have purchase propensity models, but I was thinking more along the lines of using segmentation to personalise our offers for low propensity (majority of our user base) users. There are two approaches I can think of:

1. Creating clusters on entire dataset. If there are users from both low-propensity and high-propensity brackets in each cluster, we use incentives to convert these non-paying customers into paying customers in the same cluster. The information on each cluster should help inform the strategies we should adopt. 

2. Creating clusters specifically on low-propensity users. I would think it's a lot faster than the above, but not sure of the specific advantages or disadvantages. 

Essentially, the idea is that the propensity model will show us who to target, and segmentation will show us how to intervene, or whether we need a whole new product, etc.",ShayBae23EEE

We did a big long psych survey on a sample.  Then we ran clustering.  Then hand timed the clusters to be more interesting.  Then a) built a model to predict cluster given data we collected on everyone and b) gave the six clusters to marketers to create personas.  

Then when writing an offer we'd count how many of each cluster would receive it, and use that to decide if it was worth tuning the message for multiple clusters.

1gjh3w6,How do you handle version control at a high level?,lvidzku,lvfc0bf,"Devcontainers can be thought of as a lightweight layer on top of (Docker) containers that makes them easier to use. You write a config file (devcontainer.json) that references a prebuilt image (or Dockerfile if you need more control), and then you can specify things like features, VS Code plugins, and additional commands to run. You can put that config file in a repo, and then all of your computers (or everyone you're working with) can reproduce the same environment.

I like them a lot better than the virtual environment tools for a few reasons. The first is that everything is in a container, so you're not depending on local installs. I regularly work on three different computers, so it's great to have consistent installs everywhere with little work. VS Code detects config file changes, so it'll prompt you to rebuild.

Second, you have access to a lot more non-Python packages that are often needed in the real world. For example, if you need some GIS binaries, setup your devcontainer to install them with apt. Similarly, if you're using something like quarto and need fonts, write a script to pull and install them in your devcontainer.

Finally, it just works better and more portably. I used to use conda, despite its occasional flakiness. But once pypi supported binaries, there was little reason to stick with conda specifically. Having pip/pypi perform better, along with devcontainers being developed and the tools greatly improved, made it compelling to move over.",jkiley

I'm currently working as a software developer for a company that produces industrial sensors.

I can't give much more info, and it's beyond the point of this post anyway, but basically, we have sensors connected to an interface, and the user can see the live data from the sensor, and manipulate said sensor in some specific ways.

My main tool for the job is C#, specifically Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for the user interfaces.

I see a growing number of requests from customers for real time data analysis on the interface, or with a tool on their PC. I'm all for developing this, but I have very limited knowledge of statistics, data analysis, and methods of performing these tasks programmatically.

I'm looking into online courses to quickly gain basic/intermediate knowledge on the topic. It doesn't necessarily need to be in C#. I'm a seasoned developer (10+ years with multiple languages) so picking up a new language is not all that difficult for me.

I could really use some advice. I’m currently a sophomore at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), just transferred from community college, and I’m undeclared in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences with a minor in Computer Science. I originally planned on transferring into the Data Science program in the College of Engineering, but both Data Science and CS have pretty high GPA cutoffs, and they’re super competitive. With how things have been going, I no longer think I’ll make the GPA requirement to get in this next semester.

At this point, I’m thinking it might be easier to just declare a Statistics major within LAS and keep my CS minor. I already have the prereqs done, so that’s why this option is looking more realistic. I’m just not sure if that’s the right move or if it’ll put me in a good spot for the kinds of data science or analytics jobs I was thinking about at the start. Honestly, I’m not even 100% sure what the specifics of those jobs look like day-to-day, and I’m feeling pretty lost on what I should be doing before I graduate to make myself competitive. I'm considering staying in the US but also wanting to move to Spain.

Here's where i'm at:

* I’m taking six classes, working part-time, and doing a remote unpaid internship where I help with data and analysis work. All of this has me feeling stretched thin and pretty burned out, even though I’m dedicated to pushing through.
* Will going the Statistics + CS minor route still make me competitive for entry-level data science roles? Is this a good alternative if I cannot do the intercollegiate transfer?
* Are there major differences in job prospects and salary between a Data Science degree and a Statistics degree?
* I’m not even sure what kind of projects or additional work I should be doing before graduating (hopefully in May 2026). Any guidance on this would be great.

I’m feeling a bit stuck and would really appreciate any tips, advice, or experiences you can share. Just trying to figure out if I’m making the right call here.

You'll be fine with that educational background on your resume. Combined with the fact that you already have an internship so early in your college career, well, you should be in a great position. I say do the Statistics Major and the CS minor.

There are no major differences between the two degrees at the undergraduate level. At the graduate level, a Statistics major would have an easier time becoming a Statistician or a Researcher in the field of Statistics than a Data Science major. All other jobs at the graduate level are about equal. Maybe a slight edge for Machine Learning/Machine Learning OPs Engineer roles with a Computer Science or Data Science Master's (but this is EXTREMELY slight).

Any suggestions?



Hey everyone,

I am a year out of college with a degree in Computer Science and I worked as the sole data analyst at a previous start up. Now, I am the sole contract data scientist at an EV charging start up in the Bay Area supporting B2B sales. The role has been great for hands-on experience, but as the only data person here, I don’t have any senior data analysts or scientists to mentor me or provide guidance on best practices. Same thing for my last job. The company is thinking about taking me on full time but they acknowledged the fact that there is no technical mentorship for me here (aside from software engineering), so they want to explore ways to support my career growth such as financing possible mentorship programs or data science courses outside of work before they make a decision. Considering we have a limited budget to hire me, would anybody have any recommendations or ideas on ways to grow data science skills outside work? I really like the company and would appreciate any help with the assumption that I will not be looking for another job. It has been a tough job search since I graduated and I only have a little less than 2 years of US work left as an international student.

  
If it helps, I outlined some some focus areas I would like to grow in to enhance my impact in supporting the sales team, which I shared with my employer. These goals reflect key data science skills that I would like to learn for B2B sales but do not have support on at the moment.

**Short-Term Focus Areas:**

* **Project Prioritization**: Learning to assess project/analysis feasibility, ROI, and alignment with business goals will allow me to focus on high-impact work 
* **B2B Sales Data Science Playbook**: Building a strong understanding of B2B sales metrics and problem-solving approaches (from a industry standard DS perspective) will help uncover insights that drive customer acquisition, retention, and revenue

**Medium-Term Focus Areas**

* **Data Engineering Foundations** – Establishing a stable data infrastructure with foundational skills in data wrangling and modeling will ensure reliable, efficient analysis. 

**Long-Term Focus Areas** 

* **Causal Inference &amp; Experimentation**: Working with engineers to create a testing environment will enable us to run A/B tests and measure the impact of engagement and conversion strategies.
* **Predictive Modeling**: Applying predictive models strategically can help us anticipate trends and optimize retention and revenue as our data infrastructure matures.



I’d love any recommendations on mentorship programs, courses, or other ideas to strengthen these skills. Has anyone been in a similar position? Or, if you’re a senior data scientist and above, I’d be grateful for advice on growing my skills independently. Thanks in advance for any guidance!",Food-Scary

Within 3 months I genuinely think I learned more from doing that then any combination of classes i've taken since.

One for category and one for category value. 

If you mean that you essentially have 8\*10 categories, you may want to consider embedding techniques. This is a more advanced method and will require a larger dataset. It essentially tries to represent the category within a vector and then you can use that vector as your trained identifier.",madatrev

(UK is where I live as context)

I've recently got a new role that has me switching from an actuarial role in life to a new London based role in GI pricing.

--
My switch was precipitated by

1. I pick up programming languages very quickly and my previous workplace had me teaching R to qualified actuaries despite only learning R for 8 months and it's not even my preferred language.
I currently know python/SQL/R/typescript and currently learning Rust with a little bit of c++.

2. My rank and pay have increased dramatically.



3. The reliance on excel in my previous workplace with horrible macros and spreadsheets approaching 200mb made work horrendously slow and cumbersome.  My new workplace is mainly python with little bits of powerbi/etc (just for fancy graphs to show C suite basically)




(There's also the regressive attitude of the British actuarial society (ifoa)..{just look at the recent  exam changes).

----

My new workplace has offered me a  choice in regards to furthering my knowledge. They offer actuarial exams and data science/ML masters. 

The advantages to the actuarial field are clear progression with exams but then again, I find some aspects of actuarial work absolutely dull and wouldn't wish to work in reserving for example.

Meanwhile data science roles are more nebulous in progression but the scope of work is a lot more cutting edge. 

I believe I'm a person who doesn't necessarily need to rely on titles and classification to be recognised, as I can prove my competency much more concretely.



I'm looking for people experienced in this field(pricing/actuarial adjacent), is the data science approach the most financially rewarding and interesting?

I'm inclined to believe my previous proposition but I want to challenge my beliefs and get opinions from  experienced people working in this industry, because I want to ideally get the balance of interesting work and progression. In all honesty I want to be earning 100k+ ASAP but I realise this won't happen overnight, I just want to be on the steadiest approach to achieve this. 


Any opinions on navigating this field is much appreciated!",Back-from-OuterSpace

I have 4 years experience as a data scientist, and am just finishing up my masters and I rarely get responses from any known companies when I apply. Masters degree is also increasingly becoming a must have, I'm currently finishing up the OMSCS degree from Georgia Tech which is a super cheap and high quality option that is designed to be done while you work. Unfortunately, a bachelor degree and less than 1 year analyst experience likely isn't gonna get you through many doors anymore

Another good idea, since work experience really is king, is to find ways to incorporate more advanced data science methods into your work. Your projects are good (although you should be linking to your analysis if possible) and they probably taught you lots but what employers seem to really appreciate is things you have done in a real world scenario. As i'm sure your familiar with your work, there is a huge difference between real world data and Kaggle datasets. Individual projects tell me that you are motivated, but projects within your work tell me that you are competent. I understand you are tied up with compliance, but even something like running clustering methods, or outlier detection on your Pandas dataset can be a really high quality bullet point.

I'm not involved in hiring much so take my resume critiques with a grain of salt but your bullet points are super wordy, unnesccarily so.  Also, the order of your bullet points is a bit confusing. If you are going for a data science job, your computer vision experience should be closer to the top.

I think this is the right thread for this but I'm looking for some opinions about how to approach my career growth. I have BA in Liberal Arts (with a Computer Science minor funnily enough) and 10+ years of experience in IT as a systems and network administrator. About 6 years ago, I ended up moving over to the finance side of our house where I started focusing on data pipeline engineering (for lack of a better term); I built out a Linux/MySQL platform with R ETL scripts to pull in data from a few different vendors and make it ""consumable"" by my team. Over time, I've moved into more data-science-y roles in conjunction with my infrastructure responsibilities like building model portfolios with CVXR and directly running money in a few our simplest portfolios so I have some experience actually ""implementing"". But I basically do a lot of stuff in SQL and R along with keeping the data flowing.

I'm not particular interested in moving deeper into Finance, especially as a portfolio manager and would like to swing to a more data science-y role. I'm really focused on moving to a job/field/culture that is more flexible, less ""traditional"" (aka no more tie), not tied to EST market hours and willing to offer 95% remote work (I'm sure everyone else wants this too).

A couple of questions:

 * Given my lack of traditional credentials and experience is there even any point for me to look for a job that meets my criteria right now based on experience?
 * I have looked at Data Science programs in the PNW like OSU and UW's MS in Data Analytics that seem like a good fit to help me ""fill in the gaps"" but those are challenging right now w/ full-time work and full-time family life. Is taking the leap and getting a MS degree pretty much a requirement for someone in my position?
* I know it's no longer an employee's market - but do any jobs offer things like education assistance? I'm not even really interested in tuition assistance more just the flexibility to fill in some of the downtime in my day with school or drop a day a week to just have a study day.

Anyway. I'm curious to see if you think there's a path forward for me in this field.",xyz75WH4

1. Yes. You can totally look for jobs right now because you do have relevant experience. A master's will (of course) be helpful though.

2. It is not at all a requirement for someone in your position. However, if you do go for another degree you should maybe consider part-time education. And I would also consider WGU: [https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-masters-program.html](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-masters-program.html)

3. Yes, there are still jobs that offer education assistance (and it seems like a growing perk from what my friends tell me). My company does for example. It is actually common for people in my company to go back to school while working.

You honestly sound like you are doing the work of an Analytics/Data Engineer in your role. If I were you, I would emphasize that skill set in your resume.

1giaime,Learning Power BI practically ,lv9q8kv,,"I taught myself powerbi after learning the most basic elements of SQL and before learning python. I made some dashboards for my team using existing reports combined with some other data sources. Depending on how comfortable you are with SQL you may feel good about getting data out of a database, or you may have some csv files that you can bring in, maybe both! My general advice on how to proceed is:

1. Pick data, a bunch of it, preferably from different sources. Get comfortable loading data into the model and transforming it with power query. Get comfortable looking at the trail of actions in power query and making transformations after the fact (e.g., ""I didn't think I needed to pivot this when I imported it, but I can go in and add it now"").
2. As you (and others) note, focus on your model. If you aren't comfortable with normalization from learning SQL then now is the time to learn about that, and various schemas. This is where having multiple data sources can make it an educational experience. Depending on your uses cases, you might not have to deal with multiple sources, but sometimes you will.
3. Make measures and calculated columns! It might also be helpful to use your SQL knowledge to think about what you want done in the SQL, what you want done in the dashboard, and how to do it in either place. DAX isn't hard, especially if you know SQL and spreadsheet syntax.
4. Data viz isn't hard in PowerBI, in fact I find it much easier than in Tableau or Excel. If you're not graphically inclined there are lots of good resources to get simple dashboards up and running. Visualizations can be tedious if you really know how you want it to look. Don't overlook this, one of the benefits of PowerBI is that you can get clear, wow-factor visualizations pretty easily.
5. This isn't powerBI specific, but always useful: let your users guide you. Sit with an end-user and ask them to use your dashboard, ask them what they want you to add, and use that to guide your learning. There's nothing like real-world users to speed up your learning lol",WendlersEditor

However, what you’re seeing is actually something quite interesting - it appears to be a „bounded relationship.“ The credit scores seem to be constrained within a range (roughly 400-800), and there’s a subtle pattern where:
1. Very low balances tend to have more scattered credit scores
2. Middle-range balances (around 100k-150k) show a slight concentration of higher credit scores
3. The overall shape suggests there might be a weak but non-zero correlation

A lack of correlation is not a lack of dependence.

Example:
You have two random variables, X and Y, with the following known probability distributions:
 - X can take the values -1, 0 or 1 with probabilities 0.25, 0.5, 0.25
 - Y can take the values -1, 0 or 1 with probabilities 0.25, 0.5, 0.25
 - Pairs of (X,Y) can take the values (-1,0), (0,-1), (0,1), (1,0) with equal probability.

Clearly, X and Y are not independent. If they were, there would be 9 possible pairs, and the probability of each pair would be the product of the probabilities for the values of X and Y, which went into that pair.

However, If you calculate a correlation coefficient between X and Y, it will be 0.

A static website in Quarto or Observable can be hosted in a OneDrive folder you can share with the team.  The user can navigate to the folder and double click on the .html file.  This will NOT support a technology that has a server back end (Shiny, Streamlit, etc.).  Static web sites will either be easy to code but have limited options for interactivity (Quarto) or require you to mess with JavaScript and JSON (Observable).

2. Static websites can also be hosted in GitHub or GitLab if you have these.

3. If you have a Linux server, you can install Shiny Server (free version) and host Shiny apps there at a web address.  After installation, it's a matter of putting the folder of code in the right place.  Easy, but no user authentication, and requires some basic Linux skills to set it up.

4. If you have a Linux server, you can purchase a license to Posit Connect.  This is a fantastic software for hosting apps that supports a variety of platforms (Shiny, Streamlit, Dash, more) with user authentication.  It's like Shiny Server but with a user interface and enterprise features.  It's not free, but it's a worthy investment that will increase your team's impact as data scientists.

- Static HTML Export with Interactivity: Since your dashboard only needs refreshing once a quarter, you could build it with Plotly or Dash locally, then export the final output as a standalone HTML file. This will keep the interactivity from Plotly and avoid hosting issues. Just share the HTML file with the team—email or file sharing should work fine, and they can open it in any browser.
- Use GitHub Pages for Simple Hosting: If you want a more “official” access point, consider GitHub Pages. You can upload your HTML file to a public GitHub repository and serve it directly from there. It’s free and requires zero setup on the user’s end—they just need the link.
- Consider Streamlit Sharing (If You Can Get Approval): Streamlit Sharing is another minimal-deployment solution where you can host Streamlit apps for free. It’s especially useful if you need a bit more real-time interaction without heavy infrastructure. Just be sure to check if it aligns with your company’s guidelines.

For a low-maintenance, secure approach, I’d go with the static HTML file or GitHub Pages option—it’s quick, flexible, and you won’t have to rely on external libraries or infrastructure changes.",jauntygoblin

1ghrcz3,"Is there any industry you would never want to work in? If so, which one?",lv7yafq,lv7wfc6,"Several YouTubers who cover prison mention it. And about a decade ago I went to rehab for two weeks and met a lot of people I stayed in touch with As well as many that were in support groups afterwards and there wasn't even a remote question about it.  

With public prisons just because profit isn't distributed out and given a shares doesn't mean that the money isn't there or a motive. Getting more people in gets more guards gets more political power and justifies higher salaries and benefits. So there is absolutely a profit motive It just isn't quite as formal as it is with a stock share.  Getting it in kind through insanely high pay and benefits Is every bit as much of a motive as having it distributed through a share.  In fact you site John Oliver which is a perfect example of why I also make the case I do The prison industrial complex doesn't want competition.  So they get advocacy done through people doing ""objective coverage"" which is how Nancy Grace for example got big. If you want to make something look bad then you're doing a coverage piece You could go to any prison anywhere and there's going to be really horrible stuff.  Private prisons are a relatively new phenomenon in US history At least at the scale we're talking about So we could go back three decades to where they were a non-issue and talk about prison rape and all the other issues that are going on there and thats a special type of horrible 

In California racial segregation is effectively mandatory.  Another thing I'd point out is that they can't keep drugs out of prisons public ones and haven't been able to yet is that really something that they couldn't stop if they wanted to? It is not nearly that hard. California Has one of the most powerful unions in the country and that is the prison guard union. If prison guards do something bad they have immense political coverage inmates do not. The legal remedies are extremely limited compared to private prisons.  

I very much am arguing that a big part of the ""private prisons are so bad"" is fueled specifically by public sector and adjacent entities that don't want competition.  And it's the system that keeps people in jail that is where the real problem is and there's a huge motive there even if it's not in corporate chairs it brings political power revenue and money and a lot of people get very rich along the way",PicaPaoDiablo

Fortunately having worked at the latter is a strong mark in my favour with many employers because they know that a discerning client makes huge demands and you have to deliver. We ultimately fired our agency and in-sourced media buying at the company I worked for, with annual budgets in the mid 8 to low 9 figure range.

Repeat loans and eventual delinquency was built into the modeling. Our job was to model whether their potential interest payments would exceed the expected loss from many not re-paying the loans. If interest payments exceeded the lost principal by a certain margin, it was a signal for the lender to approve the loan. Naturally, this is the case for most lenders, but we're talking about loans with 100%+ interest over time. The most lucrative had expected payoffs of 200%+.

On the models for our largest client, I couldn't get past how high a proportion of people our models expected to enter revolving door loans and make interest payments for several years exceeding the principal of the original loan. With all the extra penalties and fees baked in, and the expectation that a very high proportion would pay these fees, we were essentially aiding and abetting loan sharks.

I quit within a couple months of learning that. I couldn't do it anymore. I was already working 50-60 hour weeks there, and it fucked me up badly when I learned I was helping payday/auto lending firms to more effectively exploit people.

To make it worse: my manager, who I otherwise had looked up to, talked a lot about how many people lack personal responsibility, and how much stress he was under to kept things running. While he was good at his job, I couldn't help but experience massive cognitive dissonance at how he never expressed a responsibility to not fuck people over. Apparently that's not part of his ""personal responsibility"". The CEO talked about having to make make use of imperfect stepping stones to build the organization's reputation up, until we could work with more reputable lenders like mainstream banks. What he actually did though was sell a 10% stake in his company to our largest client (the worst offender for high interest payday loans) and give them a seat on the board. He is so full of shit.",david0aloha

Nah, these can both be incredibly good industries and both were using data science before ""data science"" was even a term.  (Where I used to be, it was referred to as ""QRM - quantiative research and modeling"" back then).  

While I get the fear of SAS - and that's valid - most of the firms I still have contacts at have long since moved to more modern tools.  Some do still use SAS for certain things, such as modles that lead to rate filings in insurnace, but, that's a last step and nearly all of the research and development is not in SAS.

The key with risk that warrant the existance of an insurance product boils down to frequency vs. severity.     For example, it's unlikely your home will be destroyed by a fire, but if it is, that's every expensive.   It's not practical (or often even possible) for every single homeowner to maintain enough cash in reserve to cover that event fully.  It would be a waste of better uses of that cash, but there's still the risk to contend with.    

In situations like this, it's often advantageous for groups of people to pool their risk - they each take on an obligation to pay for some of that loss if the event happens to anyone in the pool, and in exchange for that, they pay into the pool at a much lower rate that it would cost to cover it entirely themselves.

Not sure where you got that # from, but at least in the case of P&amp;C over the last couple decades, that's very inaccurate.    In the case of the last 5y or so, most of them have been losing money on the underwiring side (profit from paying less in claims than revenue from premiums) - only investment returns on reserves have kept them above water.   Target combined ratio is typically around 95%, or $0.05 on the dollar, and I didn't leave that out. 

CEO comp, yea I too feel that's very overblown but it's not an insurance industry specific situation.  That said, it's also a drop in the bucket compared to the billions in revenue, losses, and non-executive compensation operational expenses that are the primary drivers of the combined ratios.   You could fix the CEO comp to be much lower, use 100% of the savings from that to lower policy premiums while holding the combined ratio fixed, and it wouldn't move the needle significantly.   Also not sure where you got the $250MM per year figure from.  In the case of a very well known fortune 50 I'm familiar with, the CEO's salary was ~$4MM/yr.   This info is usually public.

1ghrcz3,"Is there any industry you would never want to work in? If so, which one?",lv0x35e,lv0tyy3,"Okay fair, health insurance is quite different from pretty much all other areas of insurance.  I believe most of the comments you're seeing in this thread are referring to traditional insurance and am very much of the opinion health should be a national program, not a private for-profit one. 

Though that said, if you're saying that you can buy prescriptions *without insurance* for less money than it costs you *with insurance*, that sounds like a very unique and uncommon situation that most people don't deal with. 

&gt; If we're pooling risk, then why do my rates go up, or I get dropped, entirely when I make a claim? 

Your rates go up because your risk profile is different.   Most rating plans (which again are regulated by the states, and must be approved - which won't happen if the data doesn't justify it) set the rates based on a variety of different factors.  Factors such as where you live, what kind of car you drive, how much your home costs, *and your own prior history - which is a VERY strong predictor of the expected value of future losses* all play a role.   

This is done so that people who inherently have lower risk, can pay lower rates, and vice versa.  When you see your rates go up or even get cancelled, it means you've entered a different section of the rate plan that, well, has a different rate.   If you get cancelled, it's because you've now landed in a segment for which the company chooses not to do business. 

&gt; My dentist says I need $30k of work, and my insurance says they'll pay for $500 of it.

This is again a unique situation and yet another example showing that hte real issue is you didn't understand the product.    When you made a purchase decision you had the option to select what you wanted to purchase, and that product, it's coverages and limits were all disclosed.  If you hit a siutation like this, it means that the product you decided to purchase did not cover more than $500 for whatever that work was.   You could have instead chose to purchase a different policy with different coverages.   (And in the case of employer sponsored coverage, nothing prevents you from opting out of that and purchasing something different on the retail market directly.)     Again, it's an example of not understanding what you purchased, not of the thing you purchased 'behaving wrong'.   The price you paid for that policy was based on whatever coverages &amp; limits were defined buy it.",funkybside

1ghrcz3,"Is there any industry you would never want to work in? If so, which one?",lv0r4ir,lv0h6zz,"The person you're pushing back on is absolutely correct. 

We haven't been in normal times for a while, but, in more stable/normal times (lower inflation primarily), using property &amp; casuality as an example, the general target is a ~95% combined ratio, meaning the insurance company only makes about $0.05 for ever $1.00 in premiums.   The rest is used to pay for claims and operational expenses to run the business itself.    Sometimes when the market is forecasted to be strong, they'll even intentionally run &gt;100% combined ratios because the investment income he's talking about is enough. 

P&amp;C insurance rates are *heavily* regulated and must be approved by every individual state's department of insurance.  They are not allowed to charge whatever they want, and rate increases must be justified by actual data showing the cost of losses and/or operational expenses has increased sufficiently to warrant it.   (incidentally - this is the job fulfilled by actuaries, and that profession is highly paid and also has some of the highest job satisfaction around.  it's a very good gig.) 

He never said none of them make any money, and he also never said that ""on average you're not going to spend more having insurnace than not"".   What you're failing to capture (either intentionally or unintentionally) there is that low frequency, high severity events are the primary reason for insurnace.   

""On average"" doesn't matter much if you're talking about exposure to say the loss of a $250k home that only impacts a very small % of the population.     Sure, on average it cost money to make insurance part of the solution to that, but in reality what you're taking about is 1 person losing their entire home and a large number of people having no problem at all.  On average, sure it would cost less for everyone if either the 1 unlucky sob paid for his lost home himself, but that's not really viable in most situations.  That's the entire point of insurance, to spread the risk around so that it's more predictable and lower severity on average.",funkybside

1ghrlfi,How often do you make mistakes at work?,lv0camk,,"Hey... we all make mistakes. But as one poster said... nobody recognizes the mistakes until they try and reuse your work. That's where all of the skeletons usually come out of the closet.

My advice: Create your ""definition of done"" at the beginning of the project. 

**Example:**

""In theory, the medical dataset at the end should have these characteristics:""

* No female patients
   * Proof one: Legal Sex descriptive statistics (maybe gender... etc)
   * Proof two: No Female MS-DRGs (this is where you find bad data)
* Patients under the age of 18
   * Proof one: age histogram
   * Proof two: check for insurance programs that typically cover children
* Patients with diabetes
   * Lots of proofs for your checks... (because diagnosis is messy)

With notebooks, I provide descriptive statistics at each filter/mutation step. I double check them every time I reload the data (especially if my source data changes). Your descriptive statistics should prove your definitions of done (among other things).

At the end of the project, I eyeball for gotchas. Like those MS-DRGs that shouldn't exist. Some things you just don't know because you're not the subject matter expert. It's ok to be fooled by those and just recreate your project.

p.s. ALWAYS label v1 as ""draft."" You're never done on the first time so even if you're in a hurry... don't pretend you are done. Get some proofreaders to help you (even if it is the client).",FatLeeAdama2

1ghmpgn,What Do Interviewers Look for in Data Analysis Projects for Aspiring Data Scientists?,luyrjab,,"In a hiring project, I'm looking for:

1. Articulation of good empirical research questions (RQ);
2. A methodology and research design that makes sense given the RQ and the nature of the data;
3. Ideally an open-source data file; 
4. Easy to follow code that is well organized and structured with sensible strategic use of comments; and
5. A succinct written summary that communicates findings as well as limitations of your methodology and suggests future avenues of research. Structure it like a mini-academic paper in no more than 2-3 pages (absolutely do not write a 20+ page tome as no one will actually read it). 

Note that these all build on each other. The most important thing is the formation of the empirical research question. I can't overstate how many candidates are incapable of generating useful RQs. We can address technical skill gaps, but it's far harder to teach intellectual curiosity that leads to the creation of novel empirical research questions. You will need some subject matter expertise to come up with good RQs--but here's the good news: for your hiring project, I don't care what you write about. When I was on the market, my portfolio was all baseball stuff because that's what I found interesting.  

Anyway, the presentation of findings is as important as the code itself. Again, we can work with you on best practices for coding, but I'm not a high school English teacher. If you can't write clearly, concisely, and persuasively, then we're going to look for someone who can. 

Not that long ago, it used to be that all you needed was some crude SQL and Python to get hired to a relatively well-paying job. Those days are gone. Hiring managers can select from candidates with a full range of skills that will allow them to take a project from start to finish. 

Finally, don't forget to include basic descriptives and, if appropriate, a correlation matrix (put them in an appendix). Your reviewer will have a hard time following if you just dive into some super-sophisticated model that neglects to lay down the groundwork.",onearmedecon
1ghmpgn,What Do Interviewers Look for in Data Analysis Projects for Aspiring Data Scientists?,luz3oce,luyrjab,"Thanks for the detailed response! I really appreciate your insights. Given your emphasis on generating a strong research question, could you share some tips
 And resources for how to develop effective and novel empirical RQs? Also, when presenting findings, are there specific techniques or frameworks you'd recommend to make the results clear and impactful for a hiring portfolio?",ds_reddit1
1ghmpgn,What Do Interviewers Look for in Data Analysis Projects for Aspiring Data Scientists?,lv0hqq7,luz3oce,"I think good RQs have three elements:

1. It answers an important question for which the answer isn't already known;
2. Data are available to answer the question; and
3. The answer has potential to inform future decision-making. 

The best ways to gain insight into (1) are to read and talk to people in the field. Engaging meaningfully with stakeholders is an underrated skill that will give you an edge. Every superstar data analyst/scientist that I know has more advanced business analyst skills than the typical personal in their role. Being able to conduct an empathy interview and then translate their inquiry and requirements into a RQ is a higher-level skill that takes time to develop. If you don't have access to people in the field, then read as much as you can. 

(2) is a matter of being aware of potential data sources. For example, when I was starting out, I kept a spreadsheet of ACS tables that I had stumbled across that seemed interesting. If you've never been on data.census.gov, take a little bit of time to explore what they have because it's so much more than basic demographics like gender and race/ethnicity. 

(3) goes back to stakeholder engagement and understanding how decision makers leverage data and research. If you don't have access to an executive, then try to imagine the factors that they would consider. Successful executives usually think at higher-level than data analysts; I don't mean that they're smarter, but rather that their attention is not as in the weeds as a data analyst/scientist or other individual contributors. 

I think it's helpful to construct a basic logic model (single, 8.5""x11"" with normal fonts) that captures how they view a process. Most executives don't actually construct one themselves, but I find that it's a good approximation for how they view a production or other business process. (Side note: f you're proposing novel data collection, always make sure it's either an input or an output that the executive recognizes as part of a high-level logic model). 

A logic model usually consists of some or all of the following:

1. Contextual factors
2. Inputs
3. Activities
4. Outputs
5. Proximate outcomes
6. Distal outcomes

Less experienced analysts tend to want to focus on measuring the distal outcomes, but that's not the right place to start. Instead focus on measurable inputs and outputs. It's okay for activities to be a black box--you need a lot of subject matter expertise to fully understand the activities. In an ideal world, outputs and sometimes outcomes come directly from a department's OKRs, but that assumes a certain level of sophistication from the manager. (Side note: if/when you are asked to produce OKRs, create a logic model for yourself or your team and simply figure out good quantitative measures for your inputs, outputs, and proximate outcomes--make the proximate outcome your Objective and your inputs and/or outputs as the associated Key Results). 

In terms of format for written presentation, here's how I structure things (note I come from an academic background, so this is what I've adapted from how I was trained for real world reports):

1. **Introduction** that includes the RQs (as bullets) and a brief justification for why this is important;
2. **Literature review (if necessary)** should be done(in a very broad sense--could be your own previous work) only if space allows or helps strengthen your argument. Keep very brief;
3. **Data and Measures** is what the data source(s) are and include here any definitions--keep as brief as possible;
4. **Key Findings** will vary widely depending on exactly what you're doing, but needs to be accessible to someone without any knowledge of statistics--absolutely avoid jargon;
5. **Limitations and Future Study** should be transparent about what your project didn't answer but provide some ideas of what to do next (often this will involve novel data collection);  
6. **Policy Recommendations** are anything that you might recommend doing differently
7. **Appendices** is where I'll include additional helpful tables (like basic descriptives) as well as a brief methods section

It should be a max of 2-3 pages, not counting charts, tables, and the appendices. If you make it longer, people won't really read it.",onearmedecon

Yup! You simply run a new observation down all of the trees, then all of those trees ""vote"", which you then average or aggregate to get your prediction.

If it helps, think of ""training"" the model as using a dataset to create a ton of if-else statements to try and explain your outcome. Once you have those, if you want to predict something new, you just run it through your if-else statements to see what prediction you get.

Different Random Forest models will combine all of the predictions from trees using different methods, for example, one method would be for the first tree to provide the initial prediction, and then all subsequent trees are focused on re-evaluating and shrinking the residual 'error' that remains thereby improving the accuracy of the prediction. That's kind of how Gradient Boost Random Forests are modeled. Another method of re-combining all the predictions from each tree is the method that AdaBoost takes where each tree is not quite as random but instead is more directly tied to 1 feature. Each tree (feature) is then given different priority (weights) based on how well that tree (feature) predicts the output.

A Random Forest of Decision Trees where each subsequent tree is focused on reducing the residual error OR a 'random' Forest of Decision Trees where each subsequent tree is more representative of a (subset of) features.

During inference, each new row is going through each of the decision trees, then going through each split in this particular tree, outputting class prediction (binary classification example). Then, we use simple majority voting to output final class prediction.

What is unseen data? Your column/feature count and names should be the same as training data. So, the difference might be that the data distribution is skewed to the left or right compared to the train or features having a lot more missing values, etc. In this case, the model might be wrong a lot more compared to your training validation results, but it will still be outputting results based on the pretrained splits.",kr0ku

But the business stakeholders' perspective isn't a huge part of it.

If clients like outputs that way, and the sales data back it up, then there's not much value in arguing in the near term. In the long run, if you're ever in front of clients or higher-up business stakeholders, you can subtly show both options to someone, and see if they notice or care about the difference, and prefer ""your"" version.

However, the technical side is a real problem, because if you want to do quality work, it will often take you longer than these other teammates, and your reputation will suffer.

It's probable that the best approach is to find a way to enhance your reputation with higher-ups in the firm without rocking the boat too much, while doing some job-searching to keep your options open.

For the reputation enhancement, here's one approach:

Find some report or task that business stakeholders, and possibly technical leadership, sees as a large pain point, due to a current workflow that's highly manual, not easily replicable, involved a lot of DS work, but that would also represent the opportunity for easier and better production of something that could represent a lot more value for the firm if it scaled.

1gfk3og,How can one explain the ATE formula for causal inference?,lui91gg,lui7hvt,"Well first I think the setting to understand this is an observational study. You have a data set where there is a binary treatment. Suppose you have 100 rows and the first 50 were not treated. The next 50 are. You also have some covariates that may or may not be related to the measureable outcome which is also collected. The crude estimate of the ATE is the difference of the outcome stratified by treatement. 

Now, do you have potential outcomes? No. They’re unobservable. The subject lived and breathed one reality (let’s assume they were treated). How would we go about predicting their potential outcome? We build a model that is trained on the unobserved treatement and apply it. In this example, we make a model for the untreated. This is where the propensity score, DAGs, and all the assumptions really start coming into play. But for simplicity of understanding, we can just say that we built the model and apply it on the subject. Now we have the observed treated outcome and the predicted unobserved potential untreated outcome. The difference of these two (Y1-Y0) is the individuals treatment effect, and applying it across all subjects and taking the average is the ATE.

One last note: a treatment effect is defined by the researcher. It could be the risk difference or the risk ratio. The idea of potential outcomes remains.",sherlock_holmes14

1gfk3og,How can one explain the ATE formula for causal inference?,luinpia,,"I'm not totally sure I understand your confusion, so hopefully something in the following list of thoughts is helpful. I'm also happy to answer follow-up questions: 

  
1. You're right that different fields have different approaches to causality, and even when they have the same essential approach, they use different terminology. It is annoying but such is the way of life. 

2. Any approach to computing treatment effects relies upon the assumption that there's no unobserved confounding. If you conducted an RCT or A/B test, then that assumption is well-justified by the random assignment. If you're using observational data, then you have to argue from domain knowledge that there's no unobserved confounding. That assumption will be more plausible in some scenarios and less in others. 

3. This is my hot take but stay away from Pearl's work. It is confusing and not very plausible that someone can ever write down the complete and accurate DAG for a real-world process.

4. You cannot empirically verify that an average treatment effect is 'correct' because there's never an observed ground truth. The way that scientists reach consensus is based on the process of how the number was computed. For example, if its an RCT, the questions are like A) was the RCT implemented well (did they actually follow randomization), is there a large sample size, is the RCT population similar to the general population of interest, etc. 

5. In addition to mastering metrics and causal inference for the brave and true, I like this book [https://theeffectbook.net/](https://theeffectbook.net/)

6. Learning causal inference is not something that you just do in one sitting, it's something that you just add little bits of knowledge over time. So don't freak out if you don't totally get everything today or if you cannot see the connections between different approaches to it. I've been doing this for the better part of 15 years and I'm still constantly learning new things.",thisaintnogame
1gfk3og,How can one explain the ATE formula for causal inference?,luiw5t9,,"Different fields have different conventions, but there's generally two big schools of thought: Neyman/Rubin with potential outcomes, and Pearl. (Well three if you include nonsense like your data scientist friend's comment).

In econometrics, causal inference is typically with potential outcomes. Suppose we have a binary treatment D_i, and imagine each individual can have one of two *potential outcomes*: Y_i(1), Y_i(0) corresponding to treated or not. 

We only observe one of them, hence the name. What we ideally would want is to determine the causal effect of the treatment, which is Y_i(1) - Y_i(0). This is impossible of course, hence we settle for *average treatment effect*:
ATE = E[Y(1)-Y(0)]

This is the most primitive formula for ATE. Any other formulas will be derived from this if you have other assumptions. For example with random assignment, the above simplifies into mean of treated minus mean of non-treated.",hammouse

Exhibit A, basically every line written in the OP. 

* Why would traditional causal inference techniques be harder to implement with modern datasets? It's quite the opposite.

* The concept of regression is not even understood. Why would a regression necessarily imply linearity?

* Failing to capture the true functional form does not result in bias under the right setting (for example, when evaluating an RCT).

* The exact goal of DML is not to capture the true functional form to debias causal effect estimates. The goal is to be able to do inference on a low-dimensional parameter vector in presence of a potentially high dimensional nuisance parameter. Within the regression framework, btw.

* It is NOT a two step prediction problem. That part of the paper is used to illustrate the intuition behind the methodology. The estimation is not carried out that way, but yeah, most stop reading after the abstract and first chapter (the intuition part).

1gezu46,Double Machine Learning in Data Science,luntkfl,lui2915,"Sure!

&gt; why apply for RCT and not to quasi experimental space? 

DML is particularly useful for RCTs because, for example, a lot of statistical power can be gained through the inclusion of covariates, and the method allows for this possibility without assuming functional forms for how the data truly behaves. It is also very useful for estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects (the same treatment can affect you and me differently; HTE account for that possibility).

&gt; Like wouldn’t DML help when you can’t just randomly apply treatment? 

Contrary to what some people might believe, you can't just control by a bunch of variables and call it an identification strategy. Identification (being able to estimate the causal effect) in this context relies on conditional exogeneity (treatment being as good as random after controlling for enough covariates). Since achieving this is unlikely (you won't ever observe skill/intelligence, for example), these kinds of methods by themselves will NEVER be enough to estimate causal effects, not without a solid empirical strategy (like RDD).

&gt; RCT if i am correct are like the golden standard which in this case a simple OLS with treatment or t-test would do it no?

Yes, these methods can be used, which is one reason why RCTs are so good. Evaluating them can be simple. But these being valid ways does not mean that there are no other ways that can be better depending on the context and initial objective (see my first point).

&gt; Trying to transition into causal inference from a predictive modeler background so in trying to understand these concepts.

Cool! Given a decent enough statistical background I would recommend starting with Scott Cunningham's ""Causal Inference: The Mixtape"". Then something slightly more complex like ""Mostly Harmless Econometrics"" and the ""Causal ML"" book by Chernozhukov et al. After this thoroughly read  **and understand** the papers and you should have a decent enough grasp of it. My other recommendation would be to be patient, as this should not be approached like a documentation to be read before you start testing stuff and learning what moves what.

Another thing I like about more classical or basic approaches is that the standard errors you get out of them give information about the quality of the fit. That's not always very obvious with double machine learning afaik. I've had to compare out-of-sample estimates before, and that seemed very hand-wavy.

The best approach always depends on the context: data and the problem you are trying to solve.

“If you over fit with nuisance model you inadvertently bias the treatment effect estimate”.

You would think this is the case right, but when I read about double ml, one of the things they do is they create a scoring function which is “neyman orthogonal” meaning that it’s constructed in such a way that bias from the estimates of ML models does not permeate to the target parameter.

https://causalml-book.org/assets/chapters/CausalML_chap_4.pdf

See this chapter. Because we construct a score function that is based off of the partialled out residuals, this score functions is neyman orthogonal , any bias from the ML models can’t permeate to the target parameter because in expectation, that residuals gonna be zero. 

The neyman orthogonality property is an argument for why ML should be used for nuisance functions, and still be generally okay. Because this score function is “debiased”.

Is this not a reason for why actually, bias can’t permeate to the target parameter estimate? See that section “neyman orthogonality” in the book.

1gezu46,Double Machine Learning in Data Science,lul3hes,lul1119,Depends—-in one context we were really good at predicting the treatment because we had a lot of relevant predictors. If I chose a random forest for my nuisance model the individual treatment effect estimates were all over the place with wildly implausible estimates. The issue was that we could nearly perfectly predict treatment assignment and then had almost no overlap in propensity scores in treatment and control groups. The ATE in that scenario will still be unbiased but basically it’s throwing out all covariate profiles without overlap between treated and control units and thus the ITES are very sensitive to those few observations. I don’t know if this is common to all dml models but can be a big problem in double robust estimators. Point is that it’s not an unalloyed good to increase the predictive power of your nuisance model.,Sorry-Owl4127

IV is also useful in theory. You'd use it like you would use other methods. For things like propensity score weighting or double ml, you'd need a quite rich data set with the relevant backdoor variables. You can imagine using IV regression where you do not have the relevant backdoor variables, but you have a variable that is not directly causing your outcome but is correlated with your treatment variable.

The key capabilities relevant to your needs:

1. Automated versioning of models, data, and code in a unified system - no manual CSV/Excel tracking needed
2. Built-in parameter sweep tracking (demo shows iteration from 1 tree/depth 4 to 4 trees/depth 5)
3. Native BigQuery integration
4. Data quality monitoring to catch drift/issues before they affect model performance
5. Feature store versioning for iterating on new features while maintaining production stability

The platform aims to be simpler than Kubeflow while providing more comprehensive lifecycle management than MLflow alone. We designed it for teams dealing with regular model retraining who want to reduce manual tracking overhead.

1geb8yj,Who here uses PCA and feels like it gives real lift to model performance?,lua5fa7,lu963dx,"Not quite immune. Here's a simple toy example:

Let's say you're trying to build a classifier with two features, x1 and x2, which predicts 1 if x1 &gt; x2 and 0 otherwise.

Let's say you also want it to generalize well to all possible values of x1 and x2 from minus to plus infinity.

The issue XGBoost will have with this is that it partitions the data by lines parallel to the coordinate axis, so in order to form a good decision boundary it'll need to cut everything into very narrow strides, a &lt; x1 &lt; b, where a is close to b, same for x2.

Also, given that the thresholds it uses are constant and not dependent on the variables, it'll have to encode all possible such strides, and its generalization outside of the training dataset will be really poor.

Now, if we apply PCA to this, it'll map everything into a very nice vector basis, with the first dimension being the line perpendicular to the x1 == x2 line, and the second dimension being pretty much whatever.

In that basis, we don't really need a forest of trees anymore - we just need one tree with one node, something like y1 &gt; 0, and that'll instantly have:
- Perfect prediction score
- Absolute generalization 
- Cheapest possible inference cost

In fact the same solution gets achieved by engineering an additional feature like x1 / x2, but that requires analyzing the problem while PCA doesn't.

Now when I think about this, I'm thinking PCA should actually work as great support for XGBoost, because it makes it much easier for XGBoost to split not along some arbitrary coordinates, but rather along the most important dimensions, so I'd assume that applying PCA before XGBoost would often lead to better performing and/or faster XGBoost models.",ilyanekhay
1geb8yj,Who here uses PCA and feels like it gives real lift to model performance?,lub9law,lua5fa7,"This seems a bit suspect to me. Realistically, you're running XGBoost on a tabular dataset, in which case the features themselves tend to be pretty meaningful already. When you run PCA, you identify the eigenvectors which point in the direction of greatest variance and toss out the eigenvectors which account for lower amounts of variance, but the directions of greatest variance may not have anything to do with the target we wish to predict (and often times do not!).

In the example you gave, sure, XGBoost performs quite poorly out-of-the-box, but gradient-boosted models ought to be the third or fourth tool you reach for in the first place. You would probably try logistic regression first, which would work fantastically in the scenario you provided. By the time you reach the point of using XGBoost, it's likely that your problem is quite nonlinear and messy, in which case trying a linear dimensionality reduction that ignores your target entirely might make things worse -- you could be throwing away meaningful features!

Furthermore, when you work with data that's tabular, you know what the features mean, so it's significantly easier to leverage domain knowledge when feature engineering and improving models. The moment you apply PCA to your data though, you lose that advantage.",Sleeping_Easy

Second, I've worked with models having thousands of features coming from multiple different teams producing them - that makes the ""know what features mean"" assumption go away too.

Finally, nothing prevents you from adding PCA projections alongside all other features rather than replacing them - if splitting by those projections is more efficient than by the original features, you'll still see model performance improve, especially if tuning hyperparams to varying degrees of regularization - there goes the ""throwing away meaningful features"" assumption.",ilyanekhay

Yes, PCA can help you not be bad at ML, but in doing so it fixes your shortcomings, not that of XGBoost. Yes, PCA can do even more than you described.

If you want it to be realistic, imagine those are just two dimensions in an otherwise 100,000 dimensional problem, and predicting 1/0 is a subproblem of a much larger problem. Everything I said about XGBoost related to it partitioning along the coordinate axis remains true, but in this scenario your ""taking one look at the data"" would become a little bit harder.

It's just easier to use simpler examples to illustrate a point and reason about it, as long as those examples remain generalizable. No need to be so nitpicky about it.",ilyanekhay
1geb8yj,Who here uses PCA and feels like it gives real lift to model performance?,luhr26i,lug4cj6,"You can only imagine such example, because this kind of data with that kind of fuction would never really be solved with XGBoost. When I say looking at the data, then that includes sometimes even running PCA or even better yet, UMAP, to look at what the data looks like when its features are compacted.


But if you have tabular data, you would NEVER present XGBoost with PCA or UMAP features, because at that point, why not just use a neural network? You have destroyed any kind of interpretability you might have from the XGBoost approach, and the only benefit you have over a neural network is that you can train faster on less data. Your PCA or UMAP or whatever features are no different than embeddings, just some vector points in a high dimensional space that might have some distance properties but otherwise have no meaning on their own.


So, again, with the premise that you are not a bad ML practitioner, and are not ignoring the data or using XGBoost correctly, PCA can't help you. Because the only way it helps is if you're using XGBoost incorrectly.


And I say this as someone who has done exactly that, and who actually uses PCA+XGBoost as a neural network replacement. But I use XGBoost incorrectly only because I don't immediately have the resources to run neural networks correctly.


I do it out of convenience and because I first have to prove feasibility to then hopefully, in a year or two, get resources to do things the right way.

This is a bit of a non-sequitur. PCA isn't generally used due to a ""lack of robustness"" (especially of non-linear models, since PCA estimates an optimal *linear* submanifold capturing most variability in the data). PCA is generaly used either for pure dimension reduction, or as a way to derive interpretable latent factors explaining variability in the observed variables. It's true that other forms of regularization might make the first point moot, at least for some models, but it doesn't really have anything to do with the second.

&gt; However, this of course defeats the value of PCA because it eliminates the explainability of its coefficients

It certainly does not. The coefficients just relate to the components, rather than the original variables. One of the most common uses of PCA is to derive (ideally) interpretable components underlying the observed variables (i.e. as a kind of factor model). This doesn't always turn out to be the cases, but it is not true as a blanket statement that PCA renders downstream models uninterpretable.",yonedaneda

Anyway, since many commentors here seem to _genuinely_ believe PCA is totally useless, I give some of its use cases:

In medical imaging, high dimensional data like MRI and fMRI typically have very complex structures, with lots of issues. There are typically over 7-8 specialized preprocessing method to use over them if you want to properly get rid of artefacts and issues. In MR data, PCA can be used to identify patterns or structures and for differentiating between brain tissues, detecting abnormalities, or even segmenting regions.

In dealing with genetics data (like GWAS), PCA is a common approach for quality control. Genetics data typically has issues that can lead to misleading results, so we need to 'control the quality' and do some sort of data analysis. One issue is that differences in genetic background between groups of people that can create false associations (e.g., people from different ancestry groups may naturally have different genetic patterns, which can look like they’re linked to a disease even if they aren’t). PCA helps in doing 'populations stratification' so that the results of whatever we're doing would be more reliable.

But yeah, as you also mentioned, PCA is useful when dealing with some specific types of feature engineering. But it's for sure not a good pair with ordinary tabular/image datasets. It would be very much better if you use those datasets without information loss in your ML/DL models",Exotic_Zucchini9311

Common example might be a factor model to predict the movement of a stock price or fund price using economic factors (inputs).",RonBiscuit

I would suggest trying to reduce dimensions to 2-3 using PCA, t-SNE and UMAP and visualise the data to compare which dimension reduction method works for you. 

Accordingly you can iterate and reduce dimensions to find a sweet spot using these techniques.

Suppose you have two independent, normally distributed features, x1 and x2 with standard deviation sigma1, sigma2 such that sigma2 &gt;&gt; sigma1. Suppose that the output y *only* depends on x1. Applying PCA onto a subspace of dimension 1 means orthogonally projecting onto the x2 space and sending the x1 components to zero, this losing all dependence of the variable you're trying to predict.

This example generalizes to however many dimensions or whatever. There is NO reason a priori that the directions of greatest variance should also be most predictive. There are supervised dimensionality reduction techniques from simple (linear discriminate analysis) to the complex (supervised variational autoencoders) that are appropriate for supervised problems.",Duder1983
1geb8yj,Who here uses PCA and feels like it gives real lift to model performance?,lub4iqx,lu9op1f,"PCA is typically applied on the correlation matrix rather than the covariance matrix, which trivially normalizes the variables to equivariant scales. This is a complete non-issue.",The_Sodomeister

If the target variable y only depends on x1, and you apply PCA to the correlation matrix, using the construction described, you'll more-or-less be projecting on a random 1-d subspace. This is better than projecting on the orthogonal space to the one containing all of the useful predictive information, but still not a ""non-issue"". 

The crux of the matter is that there is no reason that the highest variance vectors should also be predictive of the output. If this happens, it's coincidental. There are better ways to reduce dimension.",Duder1983
1geb8yj,Who here uses PCA and feels like it gives real lift to model performance?,lucstbk,lubexei,"No, in the example you gave, you said that x1 and x2 are independent. Therefore the components will be almost exactly [0,1] and [1,0] with eigenvalues {1,1}, i.e. just reproducing the original variables. There is no reasonable process that would end up selecting 1 component and throwing away the other. And certainly no random subspace involved.

Edit: on second thought, I actually think I'm wrong about the eigenvectors. I think you're right that the exact linear combination would be random, specified entirely by the noise component of the data. However, I am right that the eigenvalues would be {1,1}, and zero sensible procedures would tell you to throw away the second component. So still no information would be lost, it would just be moot in this example.",The_Sodomeister

But then the example becomes: draw the samples from a 2D gaussian with covariance matrix similar to the one described before but with the major axis aligned to (1,1) and the minor axis aligned to (1,-1). Then have y depend only on x1-x2. Now the correlation matrix will have leading eigenvector (1,1) with high probability, but by projecting onto this space, you're losing all relationship to y.

Tomorrow is my one year work anniversary and yesterday I thought I should just quit.

I was hired for a different role, but it got changed to a mostly data role just two months in. Same sort of web developer/software engineering-ish background.

I have been scrambling to learn what I need.

I am the only data person on my team/in my department.

Last week’s emergency data project was three days of people telling me I need to work 4-10x faster. They did not like the results, though the results did match “what we had been hearing” it’s just they didn’t like what they heard from me or others.

They wanted me to find trends across 150 offices but the people who interact with those offices said the offices all do their own thing and don’t follow the company playbook. Which is what I found (no trends, tons of variation, completion of a key task I was looking for was -27 to 270 days, which lead to an average of 3 days, which my bosses boss hated because she could not understand why 3 days).

When I push for goals or clarity, they just get mad at me for “not getting it.”

There is a data team, they pull a lot of data for me. They are incredibly kind, but they started saying no to these random “urgent” requests because they have important things to work on, and they don’t have the bandwidth to be short order cooks for half baked “emergency” analysis. There was a statement from leadership to prepare requests two weeks in advance and not bug the data team. Which is how I think my boss’s boss decided I should “just do data”.

This video helps me feel less alone. I just don’t know how to push through clear goals. When I ask for more details they get mad at me that “I should just get it”.",Coraline1599
1gemm4b,Dealing with Imposter Syndrome,luiith1,lubu7bc,"I’m not a data scientist (yet), but I recently retired after 20+ years as a management and advisor/coach to leaders from middle to upper management.  

With regards to your last paragraph, it sounds like communication skills and confidence need to be brushed up on. 

(1) right now you’re the only DS on your team. Based on the timelines they give you, it sounds like you’re critical to whatever they’re asking for. Are there others they could be asking for this work. With the timelines, I bet not - in which case They need you. Don’t be afraid to be more direct.

(2) Consider researching how project managers get an understanding of the scope of their work and what is expected from stakeholders. Those can work as basis scripts.

***if they are totally unwilling to provide more information about projects, the next 3 are irrelevant, but there are more ideas at the bottom***

(3) it sounds like you genuinely care how to meet their needs. Remember, people are inherently selfish. It sounds like the people requesting your work/saying “you should already know” (a) may NOT know what they’re asking for, and/or (b) are disinterested in being a leader.  Maybe it would help to phrase most of your clarifying questions in a way that makes them feel like you’re trying to help THEM succeed. A hair brained example: 
“I want to ensure I am getting the appropriate data and presenting it in the best way for your task, can you tell me what questions you’re [they] being asked to answer/present about?”

(4) two last things to consider: Would making a (short) standardized list of clarification questions that you ask for EVERY project be helpful? This will help them not feel caught off guard by anything you ask.

(5) and finally, are you in the habit of parroting your task back to them, that is you say something like “My understanding is that you want (enough) data about ___ to (do whatever - determine such and such), perhaps to (whatever their goal is - reduce turn time, and identify locations that are producing in the bottom ___(get them clarify) 25%”… and keep listing whatever your task is… “Is this correct?”

Re: Imposter-ing you’ve clearly identified areas of improvement, can you do some self study in those areas?  

Consider going to the Business (and Business School) boards here and asking how/what they would use (whatever type) of information? Or questions about how it would be useful to them. Or if they were told that office production range is 27 to 270 and the average is 3 - ask how you could make this more actionable for your requesting party.  These replies can also be useful for your “parroting” (above).
Start now about previous projects.

More about being an imposter:
(1) you’re providing the data, that is not a DS imposter
(2) is business analysis part of the job description you were hired for? If not, being weak in that area is not being an imposter; you didn’t misrepresent it
(3) even business professionals specialize in a certain area. When they move to a different area, they must spend time learning what is needed for that particular position/industry/job. Consider your need to learn more about business a similar situation. It’s not being an imposter, it’s a normal part of changing a role. ",Sea-Requirement8936

I was hired as a technologist. My technical interview involved showing demos of automations I built with the GitHub and Canvas APIs, along with creating a wireframe with HTML/CSS of how I would restructure one of the main pages of their learning platform. They did ask me about data, and I told them that I have made and maintained grade books for students in Excel, and have some basic experience making very basic charts from my time as a biochemist. 

Data came into it because they had been stuck for 2 years on a problem. They wanted to mail certificates of completion to all employees who finished a training. But we have 150+ offices. So they had the names and which office people worked in, but not the addresses. It took me a few days to hunt down an excel with the addresses, but after that it took a couple hours to an XLookup (I had not used Excel in over 10 years at this point). But I work at a front cubicle and a lot of people walked by and saw me working in Excel so they all decided that I am a “data person”.

After that, my boss’s boss (department head) called me into her office and said “I want to make you the data person. I have instructed the head of the data team to work with you for at least an hour a week to make you into a data person.” 

I met with the data guy and he’s just the nicest person. But neither he nor I could get clear instructions beyond “level me up on data.”

I got to do one study where we partner with a college and I got to look at how the sales people did with the certifications. There were more than 10 pages of instructions that I could work through and there were examples. It took me two weeks though, and they feel it should only have taken 2-3 days tops.

The rest of the requests are just not clear. Like “find me the average days people take to complete this certification!” But when I try to ask, which people? The sales people? All the sales people? People who are in their first year?” I get back “yeah, yeah, just you know, whatever makes sense.”

I don’t know what makes sense. I worked in academia and then startups. This is my first corporate job and I do not know a thing about the business. I have no context whatsoever. The one guy who helps me, people on my team don’t like him (though we are in the same department), so they give me attitude that I talk to him. But we have a good working relationship, I help him build his surveys, he takes time to explain context to me. 

But anyway, I get overwhelmed at the countless ways I could split the data. I get huffy responses when I try to ask. So put together something and it’s only when they have something in front of them that they don’t like that they say “no, only agents in their first year. I want this broken down by office. Can you tell me their average sales?”

I always take my stuff to the head data guy, who always makes time for me and we walk through my process and what I’ve found and he might point out a detail here or there, but mostly it’s all on track.  

But then I keep getting feedback that I am not fast enough and that I worked on the wrong thing. It’s just so hostile and dramatic at this place sometimes. 

I have two automations, one in production and one in soft launch next week. I build surveys with custom JavaScript, I customize their LMS just like they wanted (well mostly, some of it I can’t change because it’s not a fully customizable platform). I have built Power Queries and set up pivot tables for other teammates so that all they need to do is place their latest report into a specific folder because “Excel is too heard to learn.” So it’s not like I have no victories. 

I have been spending weekends on Coursera, I bought another Excel course. I follow r/excel and I try to pick 2-3 problems people post and solve it myself and then look at what people came up with. 

But I am just not succeeding with the thing my boss’s boss wants and her opinion counts a lot more than anyone else’s and she’s mercurial, big picture, goes with her gut. I haven’t found a way to talk to her. I’ve asked others and they just say “eh, that’s just what she is like”. 

I’m 47. I have never missed a deadline prior to this job. And now I’m missing them left and right. 

The head data guy says that he had to stop taking requests from my boss because she asks for things that are too big on too tight a turnaround, which is I guess how I got myself into this. But he has a different boss, he can say no. 

Sorry this is like a long vent. I think you are right though, maybe I should be approaching more business folks because they are very alien to me and I don’t speak their language and they don’t speak mine and maybe that’s the part I should also spend some more time learning.

They really just don’t know what they want. I’ve had leaders like this and unless you have a brain that works exactly like theirs, they can be very hard to work for/with.  And that means is probably NOT just you.

I know it’s easier said than done, but don’t take them taking out their frustrations out on your performance, personally. 

Yes, part of it is your performance, and that you’re addressing through self study, seeking mentorship, etc.

But, a bigger part of you missing deadlines and providing the wrong info is because they’re not able to articulate what they want (and in some cases don’t know what they want).

To say “just do what you think I want, and then I’ll observe. I’ll know when you get it right, when I see it” is as ridiculous as having to deal with the queen of hearts from original Alice in Wonderland movie.

1gec0g5,DS Veterans: How much of your work actually gets used?,lu956d7,lu92k5w,"Temporary alignment is always encouraged and sought after, but permanent alignment is relatively impossible in a non-hyper focused or specialized environment. I suspect some of those may exist, but rarely in a normal large company.  Every team usually has a variety of tasks pulling everyone in different directions, and different initiatives/goals to follow. These inevitably lead to expectations changing or conflict in maintaining those alignments.  

For example, even if you can deploy a product/build out an analysis, by the time you actually get it out(unless you get it out extremely fast), the customer wants more or less out of it and will care correspondingly more or less about it. If they care more they will try to micromanage more to get things exactly as they want it, which will cause conflict. If they care less about it but it’s still a topic on your docket that they want eventually they won’t necessarily fully understand their own feelings have changed and just help less in bringing it into fruition.

Only by bringing a product out in a fast enough speed and high enough quality can one avoid the first pitfall here(expectation drift), but there are many other types of issues that come about as a result of just working with people, such as team burnout, politics, data hoarding, requirement creep.

Tons of value added left on the table in many businesses in the realm of basic probabilistic modeling, python automation, timeseries forecasting. 

Example: I built a model that calculates the re-order point for our Skus by taking the joint conditional probability of the prediction intervals of demand forecast and lead-time forecast.  This is now in production.  All the value is in the way you use the tool, and you have to be able to actually *use* the tool for it to be valuable.

OR modelers have known about these tools for years, but Python and all the ML libraries make it so that you can just pseudo-code up all the routines and then Dockerize them.

I've been building an app to enable non python users like myself to do really easy python work on local datasets by leveraging LLMs. So far it seems to work really well but I need data scientists to help me spot if the outputs are truly valid.

To be sure Python is generally a better tool for bigger, more complex jobs; conda-forge has a massive amount of libraries.  It handles hygiene better and you can do pipelines so you're not manually copy/pasta-ing rows all day.

&gt;What's particularly interesting is how these roles often involved a kind of sanctioned performance - everyone knew the court astrologer was often telling leaders what they wanted to hear, but maintaining this fiction served an important social function.

1gec0g5,DS Veterans: How much of your work actually gets used?,luaaddz,,"This is a classic problem for insights teams (analysts, data scientists, researchers): incentives are not necessarily aligned between product/management and data. The most classic case is an A/B test: the data analyst's incentive is to read the test out correctly to make the ""right"" recommendation, the product Manager's incentive may be to launch the feature, ideally with supporting (perhaps cherrypicked) data to back it up. This is just one common scenario but there are many variations.

Ultimately it's on the management of insights teams to instill some amount of discipline in their stakeholders by offering two completely reasonable choices: for any given project, either a) use our insights as-is to inform your decision and trust us to deliver accurate results, or b) don't bother to ask data to deliver anything if the product decision will be the same regardless of what the data says. A/B testing and analysis incurs overhead that, if it won't actually be leveraged, could be better allocated elsewhere, saving everyone the argument over what the data says.

Make your best effort to educate stakeholders about your methods and conclusions to help instill trust.

Another time was when the company needed to produce some slides for their investors and wanted to show that some metric was going up, or that it was correlated with some other metric.

People ignore the real data this way and only get one picture, maybe two of the actual information that is streamlined for that KPI. 

Big things can be overlooked and groupthink stops anyone from asking real questions. They influence anyone coming in to look this way and help with that. 

Here's what we do it's been great, even though when you dig there's obvious insights that they've missed. Then someone at least 3 levels up pops up and questions everything you did and will never admit defeat.

Then you come back with more evidence and tell your bosses we got something for you to actually do because nobody respects my level. 

So now I educate my team about it and then it may click for them and they can explain it in the N+3 terms in their meetings and then maybe it goes the N+4/5 for the ok.

Most groups don't have that direct chain to +4/5/6 and to be taken seriously. It will usually be stolen or misinterpreted between these levels through internal politics.

1ge7e91,The best way to learn LLM's (for someone who already has ML and DL experience),lubtrih,,"Given your ML and DL background, here’s a focused roadmap to quickly get up to speed on large language models (LLMs):

1. Understanding Core Concepts and Theory

Transformer Architecture: Start with the paper ""Attention is All You Need"" by Vaswani et al., as it introduced the Transformer model, the backbone of most LLMs.

BERT, GPT, T5: Review popular architectures like BERT (for masked language modeling), GPT (for autoregressive modeling), and T5 (for sequence-to-sequence tasks). Hugging Face’s Transformers documentation has great summaries and tutorials on these models.


2. Practical Tutorials and Courses

Hugging Face’s Course: The Hugging Face course is one of the best practical introductions to LLMs. It’s hands-on, includes example code, and covers training, fine-tuning, and deploying LLMs.

DeepLearning.AI’s NLP Specialization: Offered on Coursera, this specialization includes modules on sequence models, attention mechanisms, transformers, and BERT, giving you a deeper understanding of NLP and LLMs.


3. Hands-on with Fine-tuning and Training

Google Colab Notebooks: Try fine-tuning small LLMs on Colab. Hugging Face’s transformers library makes it easy to experiment with pre-trained models, using Colab to run smaller models or subsample datasets.

Fine-tune GPT-3 or similar: Use OpenAI’s API (for GPT-3) or Cohere’s API to experiment with prompt engineering, generation tasks, and some fine-tuning.


4. Dive into Advanced Topics

Prompt Engineering: Study prompt design for few-shot and zero-shot learning, which is crucial for optimizing LLM performance without full re-training.

LLM Scaling Laws: Papers like ""Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models"" discuss how performance scales with parameters and data, giving insight into the trends behind state-of-the-art LLMs.

Efficient Fine-Tuning: Techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) are essential when working with very large models.


5. Follow Recent Research and Open-Source Resources

ArXiv and Papers with Code: Regularly check ArXiv and Papers with Code’s NLP section for state-of-the-art research on LLMs.

Open-Source Models: Study models like GPT-Neo, GPT-J, and LLAMA from Meta, which provide open-source frameworks for experimentation.


Recommended Resources

Papers: GPT-3 (Brown et al.), T5 (Raffel et al.), and BLOOM (BigScience) papers to understand the progression and design considerations.

Books: Natural Language Processing with Transformers by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf for in-depth transformer applications.

If you want to train AI on some specific type of content, your first step would be to gain access to a lot of that specific type of content. In your case, you'll need to get your hands on a lot of exams. Specifically, fairly recent exams, if you want the AI to be trained on current content.

As someone who has lectured and who has written exams for university subjects, this sort of information is *very* well guarded, for obvious reasons. Even as a lecturer, working in a specific school, and needing to see old exams to help me write the exam for my subject, it was insanely hard to get my hands on only two copies of relevant past exams from within that school to help me write my exam.

There's absolutely no way the people who hold such information are going to provide that to you. It's just too much of a risk for them to not have control of that sort of content. Even though I haven't taught in about 8 years, I still wouldn't be in a hurry to hand over the old exams I wrote.

We are using only the training data to calculate the history.

The argument in favour of this is based on the (strong) assumption that the outcome of the current row does not depend on or have high correlation with the future rows AND driver stats don't have any drift (I.e. the drivers past stats and future stats would be similar). If that assumption is true, how will the future data give us any information that will unfairly help the model?

Think about cases where we don't have the timestamp feature. How do you know that the aggregations you are making in such cases don't contain future data?

In fact target encoding uses leave one out strategy as well. I know catboost encoding improves it by implementing the strategy you're suggesting, but does that mean target encoding should never be used?",dopplegangery

I mean its your model lol, but i can say from experience thats how you fail a validators standards. Doesn’t matter, if production is not 100% the same as development then you can scrap this model.

Also if all features are indeed not time sensitive then why are you even using historical time features to begin with lol.

Look dude, you’re being stubborn about it and do what you will. My last say is this, if for some reason this feature is strongly predictive in your feature selection/importance, then you have your answer here. Its clearly target leakage. Also if this for whatever reason the model fails and is in production and execs r asking questions, dont be surprised if your own credibility will be at risk and most likely your coworker will say I told him so lol.

Also, keep this in mind i had people literally have significantly different performance of models just because our model in real time doesn’t get this one specific feature a little later and the whole thing needs to be rebuilt because of the steps of when data is actually ingested.

1gf275t,Can data leak from the training set to the test set?,lufuelk,,"I’m too lazy to type so I passed your question to ChatGPT:

Your argument touches on a subtle and interesting aspect of data leakage. In this case, while it may not seem like traditional data leakage (since you’re not leaking future data into the past), it does introduce a potential form of leakage that could impact the model’s performance in unexpected ways. Here’s a breakdown of why this setup could be problematic and a recommended approach.

Why This Might Still Be Considered Leakage

	1.	Temporal Data Leakage: Since your train-test split is time-based, the test set represents future data relative to the training set. By using historical data calculated across the entire dataset for the test set, you are implicitly allowing the test set to access information it wouldn’t have had in a real-world production scenario. This can be thought of as a form of temporal leakage because, in production, you won’t have future data to compute a driver’s acceptance history up to that point.
	2.	Over-optimistic Performance: Using historical features computed over the entire dataset for the test set may cause the model to see more complete information than it would during actual inference in production. This can artificially inflate the model’s accuracy on the test set, as it benefits from knowing drivers’ acceptance rates from both the past and “future” (relative to the training set). In real-world usage, the historical acceptance rate would be calculated only up to the time of inference, not across all data.
	3.	Potentially Skewed Feature Distributions: By calculating historical data over the entire dataset for the test set, you might introduce feature distributions that are not aligned with those in production. For example, a driver with a high acceptance rate in the test set might appear to have more historical experience than they actually would at that point in time, leading to features that don’t accurately reflect the intended time-based split.

How to Address This

A more robust approach would be to calculate the driver’s historical acceptance rate up to the time of each instance in both the training and test sets. This way, the feature would accurately reflect the historical data available at that point in time, just as it would in a production setting.

Practical Steps:

	1.	Rolling Calculation: Instead of calculating each driver’s acceptance rate over the entire dataset for the test set, use only the data up to each test sample’s timestamp. For instance, if your test set includes rides from January 2023, you would calculate each driver’s acceptance rate only up to the date of each request within January 2023, without looking at data from February or later.
	2.	Backtesting with Temporal Cuts: You could implement a rolling, expanding window where each test sample gets its own feature values calculated only up to that specific time, simulating a real-time prediction environment.

Final Thoughts

Your colleague’s argument holds weight because using data from the entire dataset for historical features in the test set does introduce a form of leakage. While the training data doesn’t directly “peek” into the test set, the test set is benefiting from a broader view of data than would be available in a realistic production scenario. This can lead to overestimating model performance and reduce the reliability of your evaluation metrics.

Aligning your historical feature calculations for both training and test sets to reflect only the information available up to each instance’s timestamp would provide a more accurate and fair evaluation, bringing the setup closer to how it would operate in production.",Davidat0r

1gf275t,Can data leak from the training set to the test set?,lug797l,,"This makes sense to me. Test data is not being used to train the model, so it does not appear to be a leakage problem.

When you run inference, your model is predicting with data that would be available at the time of inference. (If there is a delay in how long it takes for certain inputs to be available, you'd have to factor those in to avoid leakage.)

You can consider time-series cross validation instead of a single test/train split for further evaluation. Cross validation will give you more opportunities to look at how the model generalizes. For example, you mention some subjects not having data outside of the test data. Not sure what span you are using to calculate acceptance rate, but you may consider a fixed span(s) that allows your model to train on situations where there is no historical data for a driver.",packmanworld

My concern there is that I will need to continue education much longer for Social Sciences and it will be harder to find a job. Or I would end up in research or academia, which I would honestly LOVE but my main concern is keeping food on the table for my son &amp; myself and academia isn’t exactly lucrative from my understanding.

I am a Data Scientist (though my actual title is longer) and I currently work to get Data Science and Analysis reports available on my company's SaaS application. This requires me to talk to customers, IT, Operations, etc. So in addition to being good at programming (SQL, Python, XML sometimes, JavaScript more rarely) and statistics, I also need to ask very good questions from my stakeholders. It's interesting work.

As for how I got my job, it was a weird journey. Originally, I wanted to be a Crime Analyst. I am a certified Crime Analyst in the state I grew up in. I originally studied Criminology and Statistics. While I was in school, I did a lot of internships and some research. I interned under a Data Scientist, worked with an Intelligence team, did research with Sociologists and Economists, etc. Doing all these internships and research allowed me to get good at doing the Applied Statistics and Data Science that I learned in my classes in real world settings. So by the time I graduated, I had some decent experience and skills on my resume. 

I really recommend that you seek out opportunities to do the same with a variety of Social Scientists. Social Scientists LOVE people who can help them with data work. The easiest way to do so is to just ask ""Hey Professor, do you need some help?"" You could also reach out to non-profits who need social science and data work. In fact, they may even give you a job while you're in school.

Still, these certs can be worthwhile for anyone who does not have the knowledge or academic background that the cert provides. And there aren't any I would necessarily ignore (though I advise pursuing free or cheaper resources first).

Professional certifications like all the big cloud ones (Azure, AWS, GCP, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.) are far more proof that you know your stuff. This is because you must pass a proctored exam proving baseline competence.

So certs (like Coursera) are okay for some learning. They're just not that impressive on a resume, especially compared to a professional certification.",NerdyMcDataNerd

Consider a graduate degree in the long-term as well (this will give you more immediate access to a lot of jobs including research if you want to go down that route).

In addition to the degree, what will eventually get you the AI or Machine Learning role is building up as much relevant experience as you can. Taking a Software Development Engineer job (I will include Data Engineering here as well) is honestly a really good way to get relevant experience. The jobs of many AI Engineers and Machine Learning Engineers is mostly Software Engineering that requires knowledge of Artificial Intelligence.

That said, you could also start off as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist post-graduation and just develop your software engineering skills to make the switch.

1) Straight to Grad school: Will let you get school out of the way. Will deepen your knowledge of your field. Can possibly let you get more internships with good companies and do more research. Possibly requires spending more money on school while not making much or any money (a major stressor for grad students).

2) Straight to work (maybe Grad School later): You immediately get work experience and more money to invest. You can learn from industry professionals much quicker during your day job. You'll get acclimated to office politics much quicker. You'll get more experience with networking, job searching, etc. You may hit a plateau in your knowledge and have to wait longer for some higher level roles.

I’m now at a point where I can use my programming skills(Python) to automate Operations tasks, very proficient in ML and data analysis (Except NNs), can develop dashboards and I have run statistical tests on our Operations team.

The dilemma i’m facing is that, part of my tasks now involve doing these automations and building dashboards (A lot of work on the backend). While I have the same job title and pay as my coworkers(25,570 GBP). We can all do the same Operations tasks, which are fairly monotonous, and then i’m the only technical person doing other stuff on top.

Am I right in saying that they’re getting more than they’re paying me for, as these new skills i’ve gained are more ‘expensive’ and thus justify a pay rise/role change. My aim is to move to our Data Science team but I want to make sure i’m not being taken advantage of.

(UK is where I live as context)

I've recently got a new role that has me switching from an actuarial role in life to a new London based role in GI pricing.

--
My switch was precipitated by

1. I pick up programming languages very quickly and my previous workplace had me teaching R to qualified actuaries despite only learning R for 8 months and it's not even my preferred language.
I currently know python/SQL/R/typescript and currently learning Rust with a little bit of c++.

2. My rank and pay have increased dramatically.



3. The reliance on excel in my previous workplace with horrible macros and spreadsheets approaching 200mb made work horrendously slow and cumbersome.  My new workplace is mainly python with little bits of powerbi/etc (just for fancy graphs to show C suite basically)




(There's also the regressive attitude of the British actuarial society (ifoa)..{just look at the recent thing exam changes).

----

My new workplace has offered me a cross roads in regards to furthering my knowledge. They offer actuarial exams and data science/ML masters. 

The advantages to the actuarial field are clear progression with exams but then again, I find some aspects of actuarial work absolutely dull and wouldn't wish to work in reserving for example.

Meanwhile data science roles are more nebulous in progression but the scope of work is a lot more cutting edge. 

I believe I'm a person who doesn't necessarily need to rely on titles and classification to be recognised, as I can prove my competency much more concretely.



I'm looking for people experienced in this field(pricing/actuarial adjacent), is the data science approach the most financially rewarding and interesting?

I'm inclined to believe my previous proposition but I want to challenge my beliefs and get opinions from  experienced people working in this industry, because I want to ideally get the balance of interesting work and progression. In all honesty I want to be earning 100k+ ASAP but I realise this won't happen overnight, I just want to be on the steadiest approach to achieve this.

For those not in the UK a degree apprenticeships are where you work towards a degree whilst being employed under a company. The company and government pay for the degree while you also receive a salary. This degree, DTS, has multiple pathways/specialisations. Two of which are software engineer and data analyst.  
  
From what I understand, data science is more technical than data analytics. While data analytics seems to be somewhat more business sided. This is also what I have been able to pick up from the description of the data analyst pathway. Which is why feel as though the software engineering pathway will be more suited.   
  
I know a lot of this depends on the varying job descriptions of different companies and skills you possess other than a degree. So I would to follow the degree pathway that would help me hit the target as consistently as possible. A data science degree apprenticeship would of course be the ideal but all my search for one only ever leads to DTS data analyst or university pages where your current employer is required to enrol you into the course. The latter is not an option for me as I am currently in year 13 (equivalent to 12th grade) and do not have any positions in data science.

I have looked into the roles of data science, analytics and engineering and believe data science would be best suited for me. But if I had to order my interest, data engineering would be second with data analytics last. I would like to know your opinions on which you would recommend. Assume the rough or typical content that would be involved in the pathways. Where the extent of programming in the data analytics pathway is SQL.

It would be very helpful to hear your opinion on which DTS pathway I should go forwards with. Thank you.",Gloomy-Leadership354

I see no downsides to doing the apprenticeship and going the Software Engineering route. Especially since you rank your desire for jobs as Data Scientist &gt; Data Engineer &gt; Data Analyst. You are killing two birds with one stone: getting relevant education and work experience. 

You would of course need to learn skills that a Data Scientist would know, but a Software Engineer wouldn't (mostly statistics and machine learning). However, that could be done reasonably well on the side after you get a Software Engineer job (unless your degree has some sorta Data Science electives, concentration, or whatever in the Software Engineer pathway).

Another option could be trying to work as a Data Engineer job at the company and then transfer to a Data Scientist role. This will be entirely up to the place you work at though.",NerdyMcDataNerd

I can make some use of my causal inference background in that I know how to analyze pricing trials and quantify results. But the longer I'm here the more I think I realize that there actually isn't that much machine learning or predictive work to go around.

Is this a bad move? Would get a raise in salary, and still use a lot of Python/SQL. 

However, based on the work description, I'm a bit worried that I wouldnt use any machine learning any more. Also, is there a risk of this type of jobs getting automated by AI in the future?

What are some options for setting up a project in GCP??  
  
For example, with the following context...

* data is coming from big query
* time series prediction task (but next quarter could be something else, general solutions much appreciated)
* the chosen model predictions need to be able to be outputted and loaded into looker or something similar to share with another team in the company who doesn't have access to all of GCP.

My first thought is to load my data into a notebook, code my data exploration, model création, validation etc there and output a df to plot in Looker. But there has to be a better way?! Plus this doesn't scale well to needing to rerun the model in a month to update based on more data, etc.

How are you setting up this kind of project within GCP in your experience?

I graduated a few months ago with a B.S. in Data Science and a B.A. in Math from a pretty good university, but I’ve been feeling really lost on what to do now and how to actually get into the DS industry. I believe that the thing mainly holding me back is my complete lack of experience: I did not do any internships throughout college and I’ve never had a job; I obviously realize now that this was a big mistake, but it’s unfortunately too late to go back.

I’ve been trying to find job opportunities related to DS, mainly data analyst positions since I realize that data scientist roles require a lot more experience than I have, but it really feels like there are barely any entry-level opportunities in DS or even in related disciplines that I qualify for, and that even if there are, I’m likely not going to be able to compete against people in similar situations who do have experience.

I am looking into trying to get an MS (most likely going to apply to GT’s OMSCS and/or OMSA program) and while I do think that would help me a lot, I would be starting next Fall and ideally I would really like to have a job and start progressing my career before then.

I know this is basically a cliché case of “how am I supposed to get a job to gain work experience if every job requires work experience” but I really could use some advice. I’m open to things outside of DS as well but ideally I would like to be able to use one or both of my degrees so I can gain relevant experience to try to become a data scientist (or something related) in the future.

I am a data science intern, and my supervisor and her boss seem happy with my work, but I have realised I've had zero to minimal impact on any project. Regardless, that's a topic for another day. They've trusted me to lead my own mini-project. The project is analytics with the sales team. I am here for advice, but first I'll give you some background. The sales team has some raw data which they have consolidated using power query or something they were using powerBI to run analysis on the data, so a semantic model I think. They want us to run analyses on data that are not 2-dimensional analyses they can't do by themselves. Our team lead suggested we do a market basket analysis, however, he isn't too close to the data, therefore my supervisor has suggested we do initial exploration first on a product level.

Presumably, they have some metric they're trying to hit and then that is the thing you want to optimize or look to measure in terms of what is effective. Then, it's probably good to ask what they've looked into or not looked into, so you can either rule out a few possibilities, or have a few leads to look into that have not been explored. Generally, if there are no leads, then you have to go bigger and try to do more exploration to find interesting results.

The aspect of polling for elections that I was trying to highlight is that there’s not really a clear way to link the parameters of the basic sample size calculation (which is based on a normal distribution/CLT and the assumptions inherent in its application)  to the reality of human emotion/decision making without making additional assumptions. It’s difficult to quantify your margin of error or population proportion when polling something like “will you vote for X”. Certainly there’s a lot that can be argued about this topic, and my post was apparently not helpful in discussion about reliability of election polls. Obviously there’s methods to estimate population size and they are helpful in many scenarios. It’s interesting to look at this formula for larger populations.  Essentially you will see that there’s a limit of about 385 when taken as a function of population size. E.G. if you take the example in the link you provided and apply it for the N of 100k vs 100M with all else being the same you see there’s very little difference in the sample size result. How could you prove that no matter the difference in population size over a point, you will have decent representation in a sample of 385?

1) In the US, national election polls do not directly tell you much about the results of the election, since the electoral college is not determined by it. 

2) state by state election polls usually attempt to polls likely voters or registered voters. There is potential uncertainty in whether this group will be the same as the group that votes in the actual election 

3) polls are a snapshot in time, and after the poll, opinions can shift

4) if pollsters fail to poll a representative sample of voters, then results may skew. the method of polling and assumptions can affect the demographics. 

so basically what I'm getting at here, is that the polls could say 52% in a state for one candidate, and it wouldn't be unreasonable for the other candidate to win that state. in the actual election.

Response rates for polling have plummeted over the last 15 years to well below 1%.

There are several consequences :

1) margin of error. The low response rate means it's hard to obtain a large enough sample

2) response biases. If fewer than 1 in 100 respond, does that  mean responders represent the general population, or is the kind of person who takes a poll different in a significant way

3) voter modeling. 60% of eligible citizens actually vote. Even if you have good data with respect to points 1 &amp; 2, does it match the demographics of actual voters?

Presidential elections are black swan events isolated every four years decided by a few thousand people in a handful of places. The exact handful changes each time.

In the current environment of partisanship, elections are decided by turnout well within the margin of error. It's basically impossible to poll on the scale and time needed to  forecast elections decided within the margin of error.

As was stated above, the problem with modern voter opinion polling is that it has become really difficult and expensive to get a representative / unbiased sample of such a large and diverse population. Back in the day everyone had listed landlines, no caller ID, and were more likely to respond to a poll, so it was much more feasible.

1gdju0s,Are election polls reliable ?,lu2kl8k,,"Polls are a lot closer than claiming a 3rd party won all 50 states, that's ridiculous.

We know 3rd party won't win a single electoral college vote, not one.  I'm not on any ballot, and I will get the same exact number of electoral college votes as Jill Stein, ZERO!

That said, polls are mostly entertainment for engagement equalling money.  If the polls say either side has a landslide victory, then people stop paying attention to the polls that election cycle and the poll companies and the media that reports them lose millions of dollars in revenue.

Polls are accurate when very little in the electorate changes. When the voters have a significant change, then polls can be far off.  

2016 is a prime example, where a ton of new voters, primarily white men with no college education showed up to vote for Trump. Since they hadn't voted previously on a regular basis, they weren't included in samples.

2022 is another example where polls leading into the mid-term showed a huge red wave was coming. Which made sense, as Biden had horrible approval ratings, gas prices were high, lots of economic frustration and it's normal for the party opposite the President to have significant wins on the first mid-term. So the polls aligned with what the pundits were expecting.

HOWEVER, the red wave didn't show up and it was the worst mid-term election for the party (Republicans) opposite the President in over 30 years. 

Why did the red wave not show up in 2022 as the polls predicted?  Two factors, the polls didn't capture the women vote impact of Trump's supreme court ripping away women's bodily autonomy after 50 years by reversing Roe and Trump wasn't on the ballot so many folks who came out in 2016 to vote for Trump didn't vote in 2022.

For 2024, who knows?  There's big factors that have shifted in the voters going in opposite directions and that's very difficult for polls to capture with their small samples.  Right now, polls are basically saying these factors will offset each other and it will be close race.  That may or may not end up being true.

The Trumpers will come out and vote for sure. And the economy hasn't been good for the lower middle class and below, who will also come out for Trump.

But going the other way, there's somewhere around 8% - 10% of Republican voters who are done with MAGA and are voting for Harris. We see this in all of the Republican endorsements of Harris. 

And then women will certainly be voting in opposition of Trump because ripping their bodily autonomy away, threatening their lives by denying healthcare in 20 states now, isn't something they are just gonna let slide.

And then the youth vote, historically, if young people vote in large numbers, it's over for Trump as 65%+ are left of center. But if young women don't vote and the Andrew Tate followers hit the voting booth, it could go the other way.

I do think we'll see record numbers of total voters.  In some states, early voting is already more than 60% of the 2020 total vote cast.",[deleted]

I don't doubt that we'll see high turnout, but if I was a betting man, a lot of this high early vote turnout is by people who would have voted on election day in 2016 and even in 2020 just doing it earlier.

In 2020, my impression is that there was a high contrast between the early/absentee/mail voting results and the election day voting results, at least partially because supporters of one party took the pandemic more seriously on average than supporters of the other party. In my state (WI) for example, a prominent member of the latter party in the state legislature was making Twitter videos encouraging people to go vote in person on election day for our spring election in *April*.

In 2024 though, this is not a factor. So I suspect that the general drift towards early voting is now just happening to everybody in more equal proportions, as opposed to in 2020 where it got disproportionately kickstarted for one party's supporters.

I used to do Bayesian modelling and had team mates who did a lot of political science modelling, I think methods like that were quite workhorse within that field. I thiiiink it was some sort of hierarchical model. And yes it did account for electoral college.

538 got a lot of shit for saying in 2016 that trump had a real chance, and the pre election headline that made my blood run cold was something like ""trump is within one standard error of victory"" or something like that.

I've known folks who have worked in political modelling (one guy tried to convince me to join his startup to build ""538 but for UK elections""), and they used to say that turnout was the biggest source of uncertainty. In other words, huge variance and thus model error and thus unreliability comes from turnout. But in a sense, what does it mean for a model to be unreliable?

Thanks!  One issue I've found (both in Reddit threads and in my professional career) is that some companies do not let analytics-focused DS people work on ML projects, or they mark you down for trying to do so in performance reviews.  But in an interview loop, I don't want to come across like I'm just using the analytics position to transfer to an ML role, in which case they'd probably pick a candidate more interested in analytics over me.  How do you recommend scoping out how realistic this kind of project is during the interview process so I don't get forced into 100% analytics work at my fourth job?

Additionally (copied and pasted from another reply), I've found that often when I've asked to take on more ML work, the response I get is ""your analytics skills are too important for the team to let you work on anything else, so we're just going to push you towards more analytics work."" That's what happened at my last job on a project I worked on specifically to get ML experience, and at the job before that when I nailed a performance review and asked to do more ML.  If this issue pops up during an internal transfer attempt, how should I handle it?

Most big companies are going to want you to stay in your lane, or at least they'll make it non-trivial to transfer over to a separate function.  They want you to do exactly what they hired you for.

Smaller companies have more flexibility.  I've had previous jobs that involved both deploying models and doing the experimentation around it, but they were at places that kind of needed me to be a jack-of-all-trades, who didn't have much engineering support for ML so they preferred if I did it myself.

From your post, it seems you ask for permission a lot and you depend a lot on your manager for direction - they don’t have time to look for projects for you because they are also prioritizing their career growth. You need to take charge and drive your career advancement. When you ask for permission for these types of requests, nobody will tell you ‘yes’ or ‘no’. They will tell you ‘maybe’. 

Instead of asking for permission, show them how much better you can improve their KPIs by adding ML to your work. Nobody will tell you ‘no’ if you can show that you can increase their KPI by 5% when you add ML to a project.

Pick an analytics task and try to scope it as an analytics + ML task. Try to show them that your analytics + ML scope solves the problem better than an analytics-only scope. If they doubt, run an experiment. 

For example, if you get a request to size the market for a new opportunity using business rules. Show them two options:
- Option A: Size with business rules only 
- Option B: Size with business rules + ML model, where the size of option B is higher than the size of option A

Note: these are skills needed in ML roles, especially business facing roles. A lot of ML projects start with an analytics approach as baseline. By actively using these skills, you will also be developing the skills needed for ML jobs.

In your next job, try to pushback more when your business stakeholders try to change priorities after an MVP heuristic launch.

Business stakeholders often prefer the quicker solution, sometimes without comparing its impact vs alternatives, and if you rely on their decisions, you will never get to do ML. This happens in business-facing ML teams too. 

Also, try to reduce your reliance on engineering because they will never have the time to work on your shiny new stuff. If possible, offer to implement it yourself and get them to review your code.

Thanks.  This is helpful.

I'd also be fine with a Bayesian statistics or causal inference-focused position.  In that case I'd probably be writing less production code than an ML Engineer (or even none at all), but these are super difficult to find and I can't imagine they'd pick me over someone with e.g. a PhD in Economics who's worked on a difficult academic causal inference project.

I do enjoy working with stakeholders to some extent, but not the part where I basically have to be the statistics cop with minimal internal support.

&gt; You can keep trying to apply for MLE and similar positions anyway, but I think you'll continue to face an uphill battle. ""Projects"" generally don't matter much at your experience level, and it sounds like you (understandably!) haven't shipped any ML products that create real business value.

I do this but have focused largely on analytics positions for obvious reasons.  I figure the worst that can happen is I don't get a callback.

&gt; If I were you, I would prioritize landing a product analytics role at a company with a strong ML org, filling the gaps in your technical skill set on your own, and trying to transfer internally. Once you have the requisite background, you'll be in a much better position to grow as an MLE on a team with a track record of shipping useful ML models, as opposed to trying to do it on your own within an analytics team.

Thanks!  One issue I've encountered is that when I've asked to take on more ML work, I've often gotten ""your analytics skills are too important for the team to let you work on anything else, so we're just going to push you towards more analytics work.""

I'm in a similar boat as you in terms of switching away from product analytics, and here whenever I've asked for permission I have been denied. Fine no issues, bought a colab subscription, built my own API to access GPU, unlocked some benefits to the org, collaborated with the PM and engg team and now looking at just the second model rolling out in 3 years.

I find it hard to inspire other analysts and jr DS at my company but all I look for is one person I can collaborate or bounce ideas with - ideally If this is someone in your reporting chain, and ideally higher - you'll have some security while trying these out.

1gc524p,Senior DS laid off and trying to get out of product analytics. How can I pivot to a more quantitative position?,lttcx12,,"Reading through your experience, I can relate to much of what you’re describing. I was in a similar situation for the first 5-6 months of my initial data science role. However, I found it relatively straightforward to pivot from an analytics-focused position to a more ML-based data science or MLE role, despite not having a CS degree.

To start, I’ll note two things:

1. I’m making some assumptions based on what you shared, and I could be off—this is true of any assumption.
2. Your question isn’t entirely clear. Are you asking which skills you might be missing, what keywords are absent from your resume, or if you’re perhaps conveying something incorrectly?

A few observations based on what I’ve seen in small to mid-sized companies:

1. Engineering Knowledge Is Essential: It’s rare to see someone transition into an ML-heavy role without some engineering knowledge alongside statistical skills. You didn’t mention Docker, AWS, or DevOps tools. I’m not saying you need to be a full-stack engineer, but having familiarity with tools like SageMaker for model training and deployment is often necessary in roles where ML is prioritized over analytics. Early in my career, I focused heavily on system design, which helped me understand how AWS resources, Docker, and even Terraform fit into the bigger picture. Generally speaking, many data science teams struggle to move beyond Jupyter notebooks. I gained the respect of engineers by bridging that gap, showing I understood both the engineering and the business/modeling aspects.
2. Modeling Skills and Practical Knowledge: I have no doubt you’re strong on statistical requirements, but companies look for applied skills in areas like handling class imbalances in fraud detection, optimizing model metrics (accuracy, recall, F1), and ensuring interpretability. Familiarity with ML libraries is essential—this means Scikit-learn, SpaCy/NLTK for NLP, and ideally PyTorch. Industry-specific libraries can also be useful; in insurance, for example, Sci-kit-survival and Lifelines are great for survival analysis. In forecasting, familiarity with libraries and techniques to handle requirements like stationarity is a plus. Mentioning these libraries signals a readiness to apply the right tools for different problems.I don’t expect candidates to memorize all model math but to explain their model choices and variables confidently. For example, when discussing deep learning, familiarity with concepts like dropout rate and when to apply it is essential. When you mentioned Bayesian statistics projects, I’d note these are often less in demand due to scalability challenges and lack of built-in utility functions compared to other libraries.When I hear, \*“I spent time building a Bayesian model for an internal calculation in Stan but faced computational issues,”\* my interpretation is, \*“I’m going to code matrix-level calculations manually.”\* This approach can be challenging in fast-paced environments where quick iterations and impact are key.
3. Demonstrating ML Experience Over Analytics: For instance, when you mentioned SparkSQL, it’s a solid indicator of your technical skills. However, I’d question why you didn’t mention MLlib, Spark’s native ML library. Using MLlib instead of just SparkSQL can be a defining line between an analytics engineer and a data scientist/MLE.

Hope this is helpful and does not come off too preachy, again I am just going off what you are conveying here which might not be correct. But also I should say, it's a tough market. maybe I am just wrong and you have all the skills you would have needed in a 2020 job market, but the 2024 job market is all relative to the next candidate.",EconBro95

I have learnt it the hard way that it's pretty hard to really get the work that you want to do. It's possible that my opinion is colored by my experiences in FAANG where the culture is very top-down and I'm incentivized only to work on projects that align with what my upper management expects me to do even when it might not be the best way to solve a problem. 

I've recently tried to bring more ML-heavy projects in our Analytics focussed team and it hasn't worked out well. I have been constantly questioned about the utility despite my clients demonstrating solid backing and given little to no support in resourcing. 

So, I am kind of in a similar situation where I am prospecting if moving out of FAANG into a small sized company that offers more flexibility for me to be able to work on ML/quant heavy work might be better for me. 

My two cents would be to position yourself in a way that your resume highlights the quantitative edge in your work experience and work hard on the side to actually build hard skills that position you better for MLE kind of roles.",DarwinsPlayer

It also coincided with the Internet boom, where C++ was not a good choice due to its inherent security issues. Although there were other alternatives like Perl, PHP, Python, and a bit later Ruby, which also filled that niche, there was always a more conservative corporate audience that preferred to stick with something from Sun, instead of those Free/Open Source languages created by a bunch of nerds.

Also, many programmers coming from C++ never looked favorably upon dynamic languages.

Finally, Java also did some things better than the alternatives, for instance: being compiled and faster, proper garbage collector, proper exceptions handling, static typing, threads, unicode, the write-once-run-everywhere-tm, etc. (and I know, some of those things are debatable, but my point is that a lot of people actually believed them).",sfandino

I don't think this is the whole Truth.  The Truth is that Python was the easiest language for non-CS people to get started with.  The math and stats postdocs building the models weren't necessarily all trained on how to manage pointers, but they do have more domain knowledge than your average web developer or backend engineer.  I would bet you the vast majority of them have no desire to be bothered with managing pointers; they want to focus on the models themselves.

It's also an easier point of entry for the entry-level people, so if you're trying to get your open-source project to be taken up by the greatest number of people, it makes more sense to do it in Python rather than something harder to learn.

Python does have the advantage of being able to dip into C, and that's huge for ML.  It's just not the main reason that Python became the ground-zero of ML stuff.  I think Pandas and Numpy had at least as much to do with that if not more in terms of organic growth.",Stubby_Shillelagh

The Scipy ecosystem was gaining in popularity, but it was still pretty niche.  I had done enough consulting with the stack that I could see that business data analytics was needing something like Python.

Pandas was just being created and Wes was trying to write a book about data analysis in Python while coding the library and trying to get his startup off the ground.

So I started a company with the creator of Numpy &amp; Scipy, in order to promote the use of the scientific Python ecosystem but in business data analytics and predictive modeling. We didn’t initially use the term “data science” because that was still just emerging; “big data” was all the hype at that time.

I also realized that “Scipy” sounded too nerdy and engineering-oriented, so created the term “Pydata” and started conferences and community meetups under this moniker to make it more oriented towards business data analytics.

Data science as a field evolved and grew into enterprise ML, and Python quickly overtook R for ML. By about 2016/2017, the deep learning wave started to kick off and while it wasn’t initially Python-centric (Torch was Lua, Tensorflow was C++), in a few years Python was the language of choice for GPU deep learning.

So there was definitely an intentional and sustained push by a group of people to advance the use of Python for data &amp; ML.  It wouldn’t have happened otherwise.",pwang99

Still today it is a great language for beginners, one of the best for sure. That is why a lot of scientific code got written in Python, because people in math and physics departments are not coders, but they do know Python.

Java's big win over systems language like C++ was that it is memory safe and doesn't need recompilation for different architectures. It's major win over other languages such as Python, PHP and Perl was that it was significantly faster. But not needing recompilation has become less important since we have fewer popular architectures and can easily package and isolate software with containers. Memory safety while running byte code at the systems level became popular with Go (garbage collected memory safety) and Rust (borrow checker memory safety).

Pure python runs very rarely because it's extremely slow.  
  
You could argue then why don't we just call java from python when we want in all areas (similar to how it's done in ML/AI). This is generally a lot more tricky in transactional/row-wise processing (e.g. processing individual requests in realtime, for example) compared to analytical/column-oriented processing (e.g. training or evaluating a ML model).

1gb4ic3,Math topics for DS and MLE interviews,ltlw7bg,,"I’ve been a candidate in both roles, worked at a FAANG as a DS, and also have functioned as an interviewer.

And, what I will say is that for DS and MLE interviews, you don’t need to master every single concept in probability, statistics, and linear algebra. Focus on the core topics that come up most often in interviews, like:

    - Probability: Bayes’ theorem, conditional probability, distributions (normal, binomial, etc.), expected values, variance, and covariance.
    - Statistics: Hypothesis testing, p-values, confidence intervals, regression (especially linear regression), and overfitting.
    - Linear Algebra: Matrix operations, eigenvectors/eigenvalues, and understanding what singular value decomposition (SVD) is (even if you don’t need to derive it).

I’d say you can get a solid understanding of these without watching hours of Gilbert Strang lectures unless you really want to. Instead, look for problem sets or exercises that are more interview-focused, like practicing how to calculate gradients for ML algorithms or doing quick probability calculations. 

For more topics, there's a decent list here: [100 Key Concepts in Data Science Interviews](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gqPgNLtB1m4833jrP6k15JQNjH8YNlxGzbJoVcUtf0/edit?usp=sharing).

1gb4ic3,Math topics for DS and MLE interviews,ltja2ys,,"In my experience, interviewers ask questions based on the models you bring up. So it's a risk to bring up a topic if you dont feel fully comfortable with how they work. e.g. expectation maximization vs kmeans and explaining maximum likelihood estimates. This means being comfortable with the terminology (maximium likliehood estimate, marginal likelihood, log likelihood) and what they convey. Have a clear understanding of what models and methods are optimizing for (e.g. cost functions, optimization function). For FAANG interviews, in my experience you'll have one technical interviewer that is more focused on discussion and explanations, and at least one other interviewer that gets into the weeds (notations, formulas, etc.). For non FAANG interviews I've rarely had the latter. There are some basic concepts like PCA, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, gradient descent, etc. Again, the best place to start is the methods you've worked with.

For statistics (many of which will overlap with the above topics), also know the basic hypothesis testing methods, caveats, and underlying assumptions.

1gb4ic3,Math topics for DS and MLE interviews,ltjqrlz,,"I’ve interviewed candidates for multiple DS positions ranging from grad level intern to principal data scientist. Typically, I don’t care if someone can derive a specific distribution/model by hand or perform some arcane math for a given model. What I want to know is do you know when/why/how to apply certain models and do you understand how a given model works on a deeper level that model.fit(). I’ve found the best way of testing that is not through asking a candidate to regurgitate something like a loss function or the formula for the PMF of a Weibull distribution, but instead ask questions that would require someone to be familiar with any models they’ve used on that level by asking an application level question.   

For example, instead of asking “can you calculate the MSE loss for this small set of predictions and observations” I would ask “can you give me an example where you might opt for MAE loss over MSE?” Note, I would rank this as a pretty tough question for on the spot in an interview and would only ask it if it were applicable to the position.   

I will also often give 3 common models as options (such as CNN, Random Forest, Lin reg) and let the candidate decide which they’re most familiar with and then ask them questions based on the one they pick. Typically, they’re application/concept specific, but if the role is say for a senior or principal computer vision role, I might ask them to do a simple 2x2 convolution, no padding, stride 1 with a 3x3 matrix where all values are either 1 or 0. I would only ask this if they aced all the other conceptual questions and I’m just trying to see the full depth of their knowledge.   

Hardest math questions I’ve been asked: 
1. Conceptually explain the Shannon-Nyquist theorem (the role heavily required DSP knowledge)  
2. How would you model mean time between failure with X statistical model (because I had years of experience doing so listed on my resume)  
3. What is your favorite theorem?  
4. Calculate a 2x2 max pool of a 4x4 matrix  

Hardest math questions I’ve asked:  
1. I typically will only ask a detailed math question if their resume lists expert knowledge of that model/method and won’t just pick some random model that the may have never applied before outside of a toy model, unless the role is specifically looking for that exact knowledge. 
2. Why might you use ReLU over Sigmoid for your activation function in an NN? If answered correctly, then follow up with “what makes ReLU more computationally efficient?” Which requires a mathematical understanding of the two.

Instead of bothering with a database and then export again back to images file and csv ... you better just store the data as-is in LakeFS, while the versioning is done automatically for you !

Being just file, you are not dependent to some special tool for vizualization, query, etc ... you can just mount lakefs as a folder and browse like what a data scientist daily do when he/she need to build model anyway.

This would involve generating proposal content based on the requirements of an RFP document.
This could be a pipeline that takes the document and extract its content, then feed it to an LLM/SLM to generate an answer. And you could store the RFP docs in a database for later access if you want.
But the problem is, will the LLM response be in line with what your company can do in terms of the project's scope, how they would fulfill the requirements, including pricing, timelines, and qualifications ?
You might wanna think of giving the model an idea of what the company is capable of doing regarding a new RFP document. So finetuning a model on previous RFP docs and responses would be one of several steps to do before an automation system can be deemed ready to do such a strategic task.

1gadqat,How to: Automate RFP responses using a local LLM,lx367ih,,"This sounds like an exciting (and challenging) project—great to see you're diving into it. Here’s a breakdown that might help you structure your approach, given the constraints and the specific needs of automating RFP responses.

# 1. Local LLM Setup Without Cloud Services

You’re right; choosing the right model is critical, especially when cloud solutions are off the table. Running an LLM locally on their network could work well if the company has sufficient hardware. LLaMA is a decent choice for an open-source model, though keep in mind it might need significant resources if you’re aiming for accuracy and depth in responses.

If you want something smaller, models like GPT-2 or the smaller versions of LLaMA could work, though they might lack the robustness of larger models. Ultimately, it comes down to the complexity of RFP questions you’re dealing with. A smaller model might be okay for straightforward answers, but anything nuanced would require something more sophisticated. 

\--&gt; You could also resort to a combination of LLMs for different parts of the process. 

# 2. Data Pipeline or Orchestrator?

For this type of project, you’re likely building a combination of a data pipeline and an orchestrator. Here’s why:

* **Data Pipeline**: You’ll need a pipeline to load RFPs, preprocess the data, extract key information, and clean it for the LLM. This could be achieved with Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, NLTK or spaCy for text preprocessing, and some basic NLP to identify the questions within the RFP.
* **Orchestrator**: you might also need something to handle the flow of generating responses, managing user inputs, and delivering outputs. A tool like Apache Airflow or Prefect could help automate steps and keep everything organized if the pipeline becomes complex.

# 3. Python and SQL—Are They Enough?

Python is absolutely your best friend for this. Between libraries like `transformers` (for LLMs), `pandas` (for data handling), and `scikit-learn` (for any machine learning components), you’ll have a strong foundation. SQL will help if you need to store data locally, especially if you’re dealing with a large volume of RFP data over time. However, you might also consider using an embedded database like SQLite for simplicity if you don’t need a full SQL server.

# 4. Fine-Tuning or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Fine-tuning can be useful, but it can be resource-intensive and might not be necessary for RFPs if you can provide context through other means. Since RFPs can be dense and specific to each client, I’d recommend exploring **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. RAG allows you to pull specific answers or data points from a document and feed them into the LLM, enabling more accurate responses without requiring a massive model. You can use libraries like `FAISS` or `Weaviate` for building vector-based search on your local dataset.

With RAG, you’ll need to set up a document retriever that pulls relevant passages from the RFP or your client’s knowledge base, which can then be passed to the LLM to generate context-specific responses.

# 5.  Building on Your Machine vs. Their Network

It depends on their network security policies and data sensitivity. Ideally, start building on your own setup (or a similar sandbox environment) until you’re ready to deploy. You’ll need to coordinate with their IT team to ensure compatibility and might need VPN or remote access to their network eventually.

**A Subtle Suggestion**:

It sounds like you’re already thinking about automation to streamline RFP responses. If your client’s goal is to truly scale this process, you might want to look into tools built specifically for RFP automation in B2B settings. While many businesses go for custom solutions, there are a few platforms—like Booma AI—that specialize in RFP automation. 

Tools like these typically handle requirements extraction, compliance checks, and even collaborative workflows—all out of the box. They can save a ton of time, and you’d avoid reinventing the wheel. Just a thought if you ever decide to go the off-the-shelf route!

Good luck with the project! It’s a rewarding challenge, and it sounds like you’re well on your way.",cr8_st8

The nature of work is fundamentally different. Consultants are asked to come on, strategize, proof of concept, and maybe implement and operate. The big differences:

1. Business oriented: They also need to sell work and make sure that what they produce are actually adding value.

2: Time: At other firms, you may be on a single idea for a few years. In consulting, you only have 3 months.

3. Quality: Data science consulting is fast paced and you’ll learn a lot. On the other hand, solutions are seen as sloppy sometimes because you only had a short amount of time to deliver.

4. Client first: Occasionally you’ll be brought on to do something sexy like AI Engineer work but then find out that the clients pipelines are garbage. Now your job is the not so sexy data cleanup or buildings better infrastructure. Welcome to consulting 🤗

If you are happy with the work and pay, you don't want to jeopardize this unless there is a really good reason.

I imagine an updated job title could help conversations with internal and more importantly, external parties. If your role name does not reflect your actual responsibilities, it may cause confusion and can come across less professional than your organization would want.

Does the role name you should have already exist in your company? If the salary scale is similar, it may be possible for HR to facilitate a horizontal move.

If - however - the other role name has a higher payscale, it may explain why they're less inclined to this transition.

If you are primarily interested in updating your LinkedIn and boosting your career, that's a valid reason too but it may harm your position:  if the company knows you're about to leave, they may stop investing in you once your project is delivered.",choerd

Many companies structure their pay system based on a position's ""CLASSIFICATION,"" in order to keep pay as equitable as possible. There are many classification 'systems,' none of which that I have seen are great for everything employees do in a company. The goal is merely consistency across similar (not exactly the same) positions earning roughly similar pay across a range.

It is very likely, given the title of ""Data Analyst III"" that your company is using such a system -- perhaps even based upon the federal position classifications (Standard Occupational Classification -- https://www.bls.gov/soc/).

These titles are merely CLASSIFICATION titles, and many companies allow for a WORKING title (or as many have already stated, they don't care if that working title is used) on the overall position description.

ty445y,"Fan in active sub woofer is very loud, want to somehow solve this. Ideas?",i3pxmfd,,"Hey there,

the fan is always on and very loud. Things I have considered are:

* 3D print a ""funnel"" that is attached to the outside and there to a larger fan. I am worried that this won't improve much since it still sucks the air through a small opening.
* Somehow making it temperature-controlled. This is sucking air out, so if there is an easy way to have it run only when a probe above the board reaches a certain temperature, it might solve the problem as well. My assumption is that it will heat up only when the music volume is loud, then the fan noise would not matter. I have never done this however and don't know what kind of electronics I need.
* Somehow re-arrange the board on the left and the fan so that there is space for a bigger fan. I would have to cut a hole into the relatively thick metal backplate and I don't think I can relocate the board so that it does not block the airflow.

Any other ideas?",uncovery

ty445y,"Fan in active sub woofer is very loud, want to somehow solve this. Ideas?",i3pxmfd,,"Hey there,

the fan is always on and very loud. Things I have considered are:

* 3D print a ""funnel"" that is attached to the outside and there to a larger fan. I am worried that this won't improve much since it still sucks the air through a small opening.
* Somehow making it temperature-controlled. This is sucking air out, so if there is an easy way to have it run only when a probe above the board reaches a certain temperature, it might solve the problem as well. My assumption is that it will heat up only when the music volume is loud, then the fan noise would not matter. I have never done this however and don't know what kind of electronics I need.
* Somehow re-arrange the board on the left and the fan so that there is space for a bigger fan. I would have to cut a hole into the relatively thick metal backplate and I don't think I can relocate the board so that it does not block the airflow.

Any other ideas?",uncovery
